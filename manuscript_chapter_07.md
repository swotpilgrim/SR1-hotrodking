# Chapter 7: Danny Opens Up

Thursday afternoon found me in the kitchen, preparing for my tutoring session with more care than usual. My mother watched from the doorway as I wrapped roast beef sandwiches in wax paper—two of them, carefully made with her homemade bread, lettuce from the garden, and the good mustard from the back of the refrigerator.

"That's a lot of food for a study session," she observed.

"I get hungry when I'm concentrating," I said, which wasn't exactly a lie. I did get hungry. Just not hungry enough for two substantial sandwiches.

I'd lain awake Tuesday night thinking about Danny's admission that he picked up double shifts when his family needed money. Which probably meant he skipped meals when money was tight. The thought had bothered me enough that I'd gotten up and made a note to myself: bring extra food.

My mother didn't look entirely convinced, but she let it go. "Don't be late for dinner. Your father wants to discuss your fall schedule."

"I'll be home by five-thirty," I promised, tucking the sandwiches into a brown paper bag alongside two apples and the oatmeal cookies I'd baked last night. Definitely not because I was thinking about Danny Cole. Just because we happened to have all the ingredients.

The library was blessedly cool when I arrived, a relief from the humid afternoon. I set up at our usual table and tried not to watch the door too obviously. Danny had said he'd be here. He'd been on time Tuesday. But that didn't mean—

The door opened at exactly two o'clock, and Danny walked in looking considerably better than he had two days ago. The dark circles under his eyes had faded to a normal tiredness, and his movements had their usual loose-limbed confidence instead of exhaustion-driven caution.

"On time two sessions in a row," I said as he sat down. "Should I be worried? Are you feeling all right?"

"Hilarious." But he was almost smiling. "I aim to impress."

"Consider me impressed." I pulled out the brown bag and tried to sound casual. "I brought lunch. My mother made extra sandwiches and I can't possibly eat both. Do you want one?"

Danny's eyes flicked to the bag, and I saw the war play out on his face—pride saying no, hunger saying yes. I unwrapped my sandwich and took a bite, making it seem like the most natural thing in the world to eat during a tutoring session. Like it wasn't specifically designed to make him feel comfortable accepting.

Finally, he reached for the other sandwich. "Thanks. I, uh... yeah. Thanks."

"There are cookies too. Fair warning—I made them, so they might be lethal."

"I'll risk it." He unwrapped the sandwich and I caught the flash of genuine gratitude before he hid it. "Your mom's a good cook."

"She is." I opened the textbook. "Okay, so today we're working on ratios. I have some problems about gear ratios that might make more sense than the abstract stuff."

We fell into our rhythm—me explaining concepts, Danny working through problems, both of us eating as we studied. It was surprisingly comfortable. When had that happened? When had Danny Cole's presence become something I looked forward to instead of dreaded?

"So if the drive gear has thirty teeth and the driven gear has ten," Danny said around a bite of sandwich, "the ratio is three to one, which means the driven gear spins three times for every rotation of the drive gear."

"Exactly." I was genuinely proud. "You're getting this."

"It makes sense when you explain it with actual things instead of just numbers." He finished the sandwich and immediately looked more energized. How often did he skip meals? The thought made my chest tighten. "Like, I can see how it works in an engine. But when Mrs. Henderson just writes numbers on the board, it's like... words in a foreign language."

"Everyone learns differently," I said. "There's nothing wrong with needing concrete examples."

"Tell that to my report card."

We worked through several more problems, and Danny solved each one correctly. Whatever he was—lazy, troublemaker, bad influence—he definitely wasn't stupid. When concepts were presented in a way that made sense to him, he grasped them immediately.

During a break, Danny leaned back in his chair and studied me with an expression I couldn't quite read. "Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"Do you have any brothers or sisters?"

The question surprised me. "No, it's just me. Only child."

"Must be nice," Danny said. "All the attention, all the resources. Nobody stealing your stuff or making noise when you're trying to sleep."

I laughed, but it came out more hollow than I intended. "I guess. It's also..." I paused, surprised by the urge to be honest. "It's a lot of pressure sometimes. All their expectations, all their hopes for the future—it all lands on me. There's no sibling to share it with or deflect to."

Danny's expression shifted to something more thoughtful. "Never thought about it that way."

"My parents have this whole vision of who I should be," I continued, the words spilling out before I could stop them. This wasn't what we were supposed to be talking about. We had algebra to cover. But somehow, sitting across from Danny with cookie crumbs on the table between us, I wanted him to understand. "The perfect daughter who gets perfect grades and goes to the perfect college and becomes a teacher or a nurse—something respectable and appropriate for a woman. They love me, I know they do. But sometimes I wonder if they actually see me, or just... the version of me they want to see."

"What do you mean?"

I hesitated. I'd never said this out loud before, not even to Sandy. But Danny had been honest with me Tuesday about his family struggles. Maybe I owed him the same honesty.

"I want to study art," I admitted. "Design, maybe. I want to go to a real art school in Atlanta and learn to create beautiful things. But my parents think it's impractical, a waste of my intelligence. My father says I need something that will provide stability, especially since I'll probably get married young and need to support a family if anything happens to my husband." The words tasted bitter. "They already have my whole life mapped out, and it doesn't include the things I actually want."

Danny was quiet for a moment. Then: "Are you any good? At art?"

"I... I don't know. Maybe?" I felt my cheeks warm. "I sketch sometimes. Nothing serious."

"Can I see?"

"Oh, I don't—" But Danny was already looking at me with genuine interest, not mocking or dismissive. Just curious. I pulled my notebook from my bag, the one I used for planning lessons. Sketches covered the margins—I drew when I was thinking, almost unconsciously.

Danny took the notebook and studied the pages carefully. I watched his face, trying not to squirm under the scrutiny. His expression remained serious as he turned pages, examining quick sketches of beachscapes, the library's arched windows, a portrait of Sandy laughing.

"Betty Ann," he said finally, "these are really good."

"They're just doodles."

"No." He looked up at me, intensity in his dark eyes. "They're not doodles. This is talent. Real talent." He pointed to the sketch of Sandy. "Look at how you captured her expression. I can practically hear her laughing just from looking at this."

Warmth bloomed in my chest, unexpected and strong. "You think so?"

"I know so. My little sister Sarah draws constantly—horses, mostly. She's got some skill, but this?" He tapped the notebook. "This is different. This is the kind of thing people should be able to study. To develop."

"My father doesn't see it that way."

Danny's jaw tightened. "Then your father's wrong."

The blunt statement hung in the air between us. Nobody had ever said that before. Nobody had ever suggested that my parents might be wrong about something, especially not about my future. It felt dangerous and thrilling and slightly terrifying all at once.

"It's complicated," I said weakly.

"Yeah." Danny's voice softened. "Yeah, I get that. Family stuff always is."

He handed the notebook back, and our fingers brushed for just a second. I felt the contact like electricity, pulling my hand back quickly. If Danny noticed, he didn't comment.

"Tell me about your siblings," I said, desperate to shift focus away from the warmth still lingering in my fingertips. "You mentioned Sarah draws. What about the others?"

Danny's face transformed. The defensive edges softened, and something gentle took their place. "Tommy's thirteen—he's the mechanical one, like me. Kid can take apart an engine and put it back together with his eyes closed. He wants to be an engineer someday. Bridges, buildings, stuff like that."

"That's impressive."

"He's smart." Pride colored Danny's voice. "Smarter than me, probably. Gets good grades without even trying. If he can keep those grades up and stay focused, maybe he'll get a scholarship. Get out of Coral Bay, make something of himself."

"And Sarah?"

"Sarah's ten and horse-crazy. Draws them constantly—on napkins, old newspapers, the backs of envelopes. We can't afford a pony, obviously. Can barely afford groceries most weeks. But she dreams big, you know?" His expression went soft. "Last Christmas I found this book about horses at a yard sale for a quarter. You should've seen her face when I gave it to her. Like I'd handed her the moon."

I pictured it—a little girl's wonder at a cheap used book, because it was the most anyone could afford to give her. My Christmas mornings had always included carefully wrapped presents, new clothes, books fresh from the store with unbroken spines. The contrast made my stomach hurt.

"And Marco?"

"Marco's eight. Baseball fanatic. Practices in the empty lot with a ball held together with electrical tape and a bat I found at the dump and sanded down." Danny's voice carried affection and something heavier—maybe regret. "He's good too. Got a natural swing. But Little League costs money, and there's always something more important to spend it on. So he plays with the neighborhood kids and dreams about the major leagues."

"You really love them," I said softly.

"They're my family." Danny said it like it was obvious, simple. "Our dad died, and Mom does her best, but she can't do it alone. So I help. What else am I supposed to do?"

"You're eighteen, Danny. You should be thinking about your own future, not raising three kids."

"Yeah, well." He shrugged, but the gesture looked weighted. "My dad didn't get to teach me how to be the man of the family. He went out on his boat one morning and never came back. So I'm figuring it out as I go, probably screwing it all up."

"You're not screwing it up." The words came out fierce, surprising both of us. "You're working yourself to exhaustion to keep them fed and housed. You're sacrificing your own education and future to give them a chance at theirs. That's not screwing up, Danny. That's... that's heroic."

He stared at me like I'd spoken a different language. "Heroic."

"Yes."

"I'm barely passing school. I've failed two grades. I get in fights. I race illegally. The whole town thinks I'm trouble." His voice was flat, listing facts. "That's not heroic."

"The whole town doesn't know what I know." I met his eyes steadily. "They don't know you're keeping your family together through sheer determination. They don't see you showing up to tutoring with careful notes even though you're exhausted. They don't know about Tommy's dreams or Sarah's drawings or Marco's baseball games."

"You do, though." Something shifted in Danny's expression—surprise, maybe, or wonder. "You see all that."

"I'm starting to."

The moment stretched between us, charged with something I didn't have a name for. Danny looked at me like he was seeing me for the first time, really seeing me. And I realized with a start that I was seeing him too—not the leather jacket or the reputation, but the person underneath. The brother who bought yard sale books and sanded down bats. The son trying to fill his father's impossible shoes. The boy who was more than Coral Bay had decided he was.

"We should get back to algebra," I said, but I didn't move to open the textbook.

"Yeah." Danny didn't move either. "Probably should."

Another beat of silence. Then Danny cleared his throat and reached for his notebook. "Okay, so. Ratios. What's next?"

We worked through the remaining problems, but something had changed in the quality of our interaction. The conversation flowed more easily. When I explained a concept, Danny listened with full attention. When he got something right, we both grinned like it was a shared victory.

He ate both cookies ("Not lethal—actually pretty good") and the apple I insisted I was too full to finish. By the time two hours had passed, we'd covered more material than any previous session.

"Same time next week?" Danny asked as we packed up.

"Tuesday and Thursday," I confirmed. "Two o'clock."

"I'll be here." He paused, the notebook clutched in one hand. "Betty Ann?"

"Yeah?"

"Thanks. For the sandwiches and stuff. And for..." He gestured vaguely. "Listening. About my family. I don't usually talk about all that."

"I'm glad you did." And I meant it. "I want to understand."

Something flickered in his eyes—gratitude, warmth, something that made my pulse quicken. "You're not what I expected."

"Neither are you."

A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth, a real one that reached his eyes and made him look younger, less burdened. "Guess we both had the wrong idea."

"Guess so."

After he left, I sat at the table for a few extra minutes, processing. The session had felt different—more personal, more honest. We'd crossed some invisible line from tutor-and-student into something else. Not quite friends, but heading in that direction.

The realization should have worried me. Danny Cole was still the boy my father would disapprove of, still from the wrong side of Coral Bay, still carrying a reputation I was supposed to stay far away from.

But as I walked home through the humid afternoon, I couldn't bring myself to care about any of that.

I'd learned something important today: Danny Cole wasn't trapped by circumstances he couldn't control, working himself to exhaustion for people he loved. He was thoughtful and perceptive and kind in ways most people never bothered to notice.

And somewhere in the past two sessions, I'd started to care what happened to him.

That night, I made a batch of peanut butter cookies—Danny's favorite, he'd mentioned in passing. I wrapped them carefully and added them to my bag for Tuesday's session, already planning to claim I'd made too many.

My mother noticed my humming while I cleaned up the kitchen. "You're in a good mood."

"Just a nice day," I said, which was true enough.

What I didn't say: that I was thinking about dark eyes and rare smiles and the way Danny's whole face had softened when he talked about his siblings. That I was already looking forward to Tuesday, to two more hours of algebra and conversation and slowly learning the real Danny Cole.

That somewhere along the way, tutoring had stopped feeling like an obligation and started feeling like the best part of my week.

My mother would worry if she knew. My father would forbid it outright. Sandy would warn me to be careful, to protect my reputation.

But in my room that night, I pulled out my sketchbook and drew from memory: Danny's hands holding the sandwich I'd brought him, the gratitude he'd tried to hide. His expression when talking about Tommy and Sarah and Marco. The way he'd looked at my sketches like they mattered.

The way he'd looked at me like I mattered.

I was in dangerous territory, I knew. Getting close to Danny Cole would only lead to complications. Complications I should avoid.

But as I added careful shading to his portrait, I couldn't make myself pull back.

Not when I'd finally found someone who saw past the perfect daughter to the real person underneath.

Not when he'd trusted me with his truth, and I'd started to trust him with mine.
