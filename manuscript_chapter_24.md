# Chapter 24: The Sock Hop

I took Danny's hand and turned to face the small crowd watching us. My heart was still racing from the kiss, from the declaration, from the sheer enormity of what I'd just done.

Sandy started clapping first. Slow, deliberate claps that echoed across the parking lot. Then Tommy joined in, Danny's younger brother grinning from ear to ear. Rico whistled appreciatively. A few others—some I knew, some I didn't—added their applause.

Not everyone. Some of the church youth group girls looked scandalized, whispering furiously to each other. A couple of boys I didn't recognize smirked like they'd just witnessed something salacious. But enough people clapped. Enough to matter.

Sandy pushed through the crowd and hugged me fiercely. "I'm so proud of you," she whispered in my ear.

I hugged her back, grateful beyond words for her friendship.

The moment broke as people began drifting back inside or dispersing to their cars. The show was over. But the talking—that was just beginning.

Danny's arm was around my waist, solid and real. "You know your father's going to hear about this by morning," he said quietly.

"Probably by tonight," I corrected. "Mrs. Patterson from church was in that crowd. She'll be on the phone before she even gets home."

"Are you scared?"

I considered the question honestly. "Terrified," I admitted. "But also... I don't know. Free? I'm done hiding. Done apologizing. Whatever happens, at least it'll be honest."

Danny pulled me closer. "You're the bravest person I've ever met."

"Says the boy who works two jobs to support his family," I said. "Who rebuilt an entire car engine from scratch. Who won a street race against Snake Brennan."

"That's different. That's just... life. What you did—" He shook his head in wonder. "You climbed out a window. You defied everything you've ever known. For me."

"For us," I corrected. "And for myself."

The music from inside the gym shifted to something upbeat—"Rock Around the Clock" again, the jukebox apparently on repeat. Through the open doors, I could see couples dancing, the party continuing without us.

"Do you want to go back inside?" Danny asked. "Actually go to the sock hop?"

I looked down at my torn cardigan, my scratched hands, my slightly rumpled dress. Then I looked at Danny in his white button-down, his hair slightly mussed from my fingers. We'd just declared ourselves publicly. Everyone already knew.

"Yes," I said. "I want to dance with you."

Danny's smile was brilliant. "Then let's dance."

We walked back to the gymnasium entrance hand in hand. Sandy fell in step beside us, still beaming. "This is going to be the talk of Coral Bay for months," she said cheerfully.

"Years, probably," I agreed.

"Worth it?"

I squeezed Danny's hand. "Worth it."

We entered the gymnasium together. The party was in full swing—the fast song had everyone on the dance floor, twirling and laughing. The temperature had risen with all the bodies packed together, and someone had opened more windows for ventilation.

People noticed us immediately, of course. Conversations paused. Heads turned. But this time, instead of shrinking from the attention, I walked straight through it.

Danny led me onto the dance floor just as the song changed to something slower—"Only You" by The Platters. Perfect timing.

"I've never danced at a sock hop before," Danny admitted as he put his arms around me. "Actually, I've never really danced much at all."

"Me neither," I confessed. "My parents only let me go to church socials, and the dancing there is very... supervised."

"Well, we're supervised now," Danny pointed out, nodding toward the chaperones positioned around the gym. Mrs. Henderson, my algebra teacher, watched from near the punch table with an expression I couldn't quite read. Mr. Griggs, the math teacher, looked disapproving. But Mrs. Henderson caught my eye and gave me the tiniest nod.

She'd known, I realized. When she'd assigned Danny to tutor with me, she'd known exactly what might happen. And she'd done it anyway.

I'd have to thank her someday.

For now, I focused on Danny. On the feel of his hand on my back, proper and respectful despite everything. On our fingers intertwined. On the way he looked at me like I was something precious.

We swayed to the music, not particularly skilled but not caring. Around us, other couples danced. Some pointedly ignored us. Others shot us curious looks. Tommy danced past with a girl his own age and gave Danny a thumbs up that made his brother laugh.

"Your brother seems happy you're staying," I observed.

"He threatened to never speak to me again if I left," Danny said. "He's the one who made me realize I was being an idiot. Him and my mother."

"Your mother?"

"Told me I was no better than your father if I made decisions for you without giving you a choice." Danny's expression was rueful. "She was right."

"Mothers usually are," I said. Then, "Will I get to meet her? Properly, I mean? Not just as your tutor?"

"If you want to," Danny said. "Though I warn you, she'll probably interrogate you and ask if you're sure about me at least three times."

"I'm sure," I said firmly. "I'll tell her as many times as she needs to hear it."

The song shifted to something faster—"Great Balls of Fire." Danny spun me out and pulled me back in, and I laughed, breathless and happy. We weren't good dancers, but it didn't matter. We were dancing together, publicly, choosing each other in front of everyone.

The fast song ended and another slow one began. "Earth Angel" this time, dreamy and romantic. Danny pulled me close again, and I rested my head on his shoulder, breathing in the scent of him—motor oil and soap and something distinctly Danny.

"What happens Monday?" he asked quietly. "When we have to face reality again?"

"Reality is that I'm probably going to be in the worst trouble of my life," I said honestly. "My father might send me to Georgia like he threatened. My mother will be devastated. The church ladies will gossip for months."

"We could still—"

I pulled back to look at him. "No. No more running. No more sacrificing. We face it together, remember?"

"Together," Danny agreed. He kissed my forehead gently, chaste enough for the chaperones but intimate enough to make my heart flutter.

We danced through several more songs. Sandy danced nearby with a boy from school, shooting me encouraging smiles. Rico and his date passed us, Rico nodding approval at Danny. Even some of the initial skeptics seemed to be softening—if not accepting, at least no longer actively hostile.

Not everyone, of course. The church youth group girls maintained their disapproving cluster by the punch bowl. Mr. Griggs watched with his arms crossed. I caught whispers and pointed looks from various corners.

But I also caught smiles. Nods. A few girls looking at me with something like admiration—Betty Ann Morrison, who'd never broken a rule in her life, had climbed out a window for love.

Maybe I was giving them permission to be brave too.

The clock on the gym wall showed nearly ten o'clock. The dance would end at ten-thirty. My parents' church meeting was supposed to go until nine-thirty, but they often ran late. Still, I'd need to face them eventually.

"I should probably get home before my parents do," I said reluctantly. "If they find my room empty with the door still locked, they'll know I climbed out. Better if I can climb back in before they return."

Danny looked alarmed. "You're planning to climb back up that trellis? In the dark?"

"How else am I supposed to get back in my room? The door's locked from the outside."

"Betty Ann, you could break your neck."

"I'll be fine. I made it down, didn't I?"

"That was before, when you had adrenaline and desperation. Now you're tired and—"

"I'll help her," Sandy interjected, appearing beside us. "I've climbed that trellis before, actually. Last summer when we had a sleepover. It's not that bad if you know where the strong boards are."

Danny still looked unhappy but nodded. "Be careful. Please."

"I will." I stood on my toes and kissed him softly, not caring who saw. "This wasn't for nothing, okay? No matter what happens Monday, tonight was real."

"Tonight was everything," Danny said.

Sandy tugged my arm. "We should go. It's almost ten."

I let her pull me toward the exit, but I kept looking back at Danny until the crowd swallowed him from view.

Outside, the warm night air felt cool after the heated gymnasium. Sandy and I hurried to her car.

"That was the most romantic thing I've ever seen," Sandy said as she started the engine. "The kiss, the declaration, the dancing. It was like something from a movie."

"It felt like a movie," I admitted. "Terrifying and exhilarating and possibly stupid."

"Definitely not stupid," Sandy said firmly. "Brave. Honest. Real."

We drove through the quiet streets of Coral Bay, past the darkened shops on Main Street, past the church where my parents were probably just finishing their meeting. Sandy turned onto my street with the headlights off, parking a block away.

We crept through backyards to my house. The driveway was still empty—my parents weren't home yet. Thank God.

The rose trellis loomed in the darkness, looking much more intimidating than it had going down.

"Okay," Sandy whispered. "Step on the right side boards—they're stronger. Avoid the left middle one, that's the one that cracked earlier. Use the window frame to pull yourself up at the top."

"You've really done this before?"

"Last summer when we stayed up too late talking and your dad locked us in for curfew. I snuck out to move my car so he wouldn't see it in the morning and know I'd stayed over." Sandy grinned. "Good girl Betty Ann didn't notice."

I laughed quietly. "I was pretty oblivious, wasn't I?"

"You were perfect," Sandy corrected. "But I like this version better. The one who climbs out windows."

I hugged her quickly. "Thank you. For everything."

"That's what best friends are for. Now go, before your parents get home."

I approached the trellis, found a foothold, and started climbing. It was harder going up than coming down—gravity worked against me now, and my arms were tired. Thorns caught at my already-torn cardigan. My scratched hands protested.

But I kept climbing. Past the cracked board, careful with my weight. Past the tangled rose vines. Up toward my bedroom window, still open from earlier.

I was almost there when I heard a car engine.

My parents.

I scrambled faster, scraping my shin on the wood. Grabbed the window frame and hauled myself up and through just as headlights swept the driveway.

I landed in a heap on my bedroom floor, breathing hard.

Footsteps on the porch. The front door opening. My mother's voice saying something to my father.

I quickly smoothed my dress, wiped the dirt from my knees, and dove into bed fully clothed. Pulled the covers up to my chin just as I heard my father's footsteps on the stairs.

The key turned in my lock. The door opened.

My father peered in, checking that I was there. In the darkness, with me under the covers, he apparently saw what he expected to see—his daughter, obediently in bed where he'd left her.

The door closed. The lock clicked.

I lay in the darkness, heart pounding, pink polka dot dress still on under the covers, scratched hands hidden, the taste of Danny's kiss still on my lips.

I'd done it. I'd climbed out, found Danny, declared myself, danced at the sock hop, and climbed back in without getting caught.

Tomorrow would bring consequences—I had no illusions about that. Mrs. Patterson or someone else would tell. The whole town would know.

But tonight, I'd been brave. I'd chosen myself. I'd chosen love.

And I wasn't sorry.

Not even a little bit.
