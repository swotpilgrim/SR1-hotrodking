# Chapter 25: Finding Him

I didn't actually write Chapter 24 about finding him at the sock hop - I wrote about the sock hop itself. Let me write the correct Chapter 25 based on the outline, which continues from the kiss and crowd gathering.

Actually, looking back at the outline, Chapter 25 "Finding Him" should be the emotional climax where Betty Ann and Danny confront their feelings after she finds him in the parking lot. But I already covered that in Chapter 23-24.

Let me write Chapter 25 following the detailed outline provided:

# Chapter 25: Finding Him

The crowd still watched us—scattered across the parking lot, standing in the gymnasium doorway, witnesses to Betty Ann Morrison kissing Danny Cole. To my public declaration. To everything changing.

My hand was still in Danny's. His other arm around my waist. I could feel him trembling slightly, or maybe that was me. Maybe it was both of us, shaking with the enormity of what we'd just done.

"Betty Ann," Danny said quietly, his voice rough. "What you just said—"

"I meant it," I interrupted. "Every word."

"Everyone heard you."

"Good." I turned to face him fully, keeping our hands linked. "I'm tired of hiding. Tired of being ashamed of what I want. Of who I want."

Danny's eyes searched mine. "You're not going to regret this tomorrow? When you're facing your father's anger? When the whole town is talking?"

"I might regret climbing that trellis when my shin bruises," I said, trying for lightness. "But choosing you? Never."

He pulled me close then, pressing his forehead to mine. "I don't deserve you."

"Stop saying that," I said fiercely. "You deserve everything good. You deserve someone who fights for you. Let me fight for you, Danny. Let me choose you every day."

"Your father—"

"Will be angry. Probably furious." I took a deep breath. "He might send me to Georgia like he threatened. But even if he does, I'll find my way back. I'll write to you every day. I'll count down until I turn eighteen and can make my own choices legally. This isn't over just because my father says so."

Danny's grip on me tightened. "You've thought this through."

"I've thought of nothing else since Sandy told me you were leaving." I pulled back to meet his eyes. "I climbed out a second-story window, Danny. I defied every rule I've ever lived by. Do you really think I'm going to give up now?"

A smile tugged at his lips. "You climbed out a window."

"I did."

"Betty Ann Morrison, straight-A student, church volunteer, good girl—climbed out her bedroom window to chase down a hot rod racer from the wrong side of town."

"When you say it like that, it sounds insane."

"It is insane," Danny said. But he was smiling now, really smiling. "It's the most insane, brave, wonderful thing anyone's ever done for me."

"Good," I said. "Because I plan to do a lot more insane, brave things. Starting with facing my father tomorrow and telling him I'm not giving you up."

"Betty Ann—"

"And you're going to finish school properly this time," I continued. "Really finish. Graduate. Because you're smart enough to do it, and you deserve that diploma."

"Yes ma'am," Danny said, but there was warmth in his voice.

"And I'm applying to art school. Atlanta College of Art, like I've been researching. With or without my parents' blessing."

"That's a few hours away."

"So we'll write letters. And you'll visit on weekends when you can. And in a year or two, when you've saved enough, maybe you'll move there too. Open that garage you've always dreamed about."

Danny was staring at me like he'd never seen me before. "You've really planned this out."

"I had two days locked in my room with nothing to do but think." I touched his face gently. "I love you. That's not going away just because it's hard. Hard things are worth doing."

"I love you too," Danny said. "So much it scares me."

"Me too. But let's be scared together."

He kissed me then, softer than before. Tender and sweet and full of promise. When we broke apart, I realized the crowd had mostly dispersed. Only a few people remained—Sandy standing guard near the gym doors, Tommy leaning against a car with his arms crossed and a satisfied smirk, and a few curious onlookers who'd stayed for the show.

"We should probably go back inside," I said reluctantly. "Before the chaperones come looking."

"Or we could not," Danny suggested. "We could just... talk. Out here. Where it's quieter."

I considered. The dance would end in thirty minutes. My parents would be home soon after. This might be my last bit of freedom before facing the consequences.

"Okay," I said. "Let's talk."

We moved away from the crowd, toward Danny's motorcycle. He'd already started unpacking his duffel bag at some point—I noticed it was open, clothes spilling out. He must have been in the middle of changing his mind when I'd found him.

"Were you really going to leave?" I asked.

"I was," Danny admitted. "I'd convinced myself it was the noble thing to do. The right thing."

"What changed your mind?"

"You." He sat on the ground, back against the equipment shed wall, and pulled me down beside him. "You climbed out a window. You risked everything. You told me I didn't get to decide for you." He shook his head. "My mother told me I was being as controlling as your father. Tommy called me a coward. They were both right."

"You're not a coward," I said. "You were scared. There's a difference."

"I was terrified," Danny corrected. "Still am, honestly. Your father's going to hate me. The town already looks down on me. I have nothing to offer you except—"

I put my finger on his lips. "Stop. You keep saying you have nothing to offer. But you've given me everything that matters. You see me—really see me. You make me want to be brave. You believe in my art when no one else does. You treat me like I'm capable of making my own choices."

I removed my finger and he captured my hand, kissing my scratched palm gently. "These hands. You hurt them climbing that trellis."

"Battle scars," I said. "I earned them."

"Your cardigan's ruined too."

"I have others."

"And your father's going to ground you for life."

"Probably," I agreed cheerfully. "But at least I'll have done something worth being grounded for."

Danny laughed, the sound surprised out of him. "You're amazing."

"I'm terrified," I corrected. "But I'm done letting fear make my choices for me."

We sat in comfortable silence for a moment, my head on his shoulder, his arm around me. Music drifted from the gymnasium—something slow and romantic. I could hear laughter, the sounds of the dance continuing without us.

"What's the first thing your father's going to say when he finds out?" Danny asked.

"Probably 'I'm disappointed in you,'" I said. "That's his favorite."

"And your mother?"

"She'll cry. She hates conflict. She'll want me to apologize and smooth things over and go back to being the good daughter."

"Are you going to?"

"No," I said firmly. "I'm done apologizing for wanting things. For having dreams. For choosing my own path."

"Even if they send you to Georgia?"

"Even then." I tilted my head to look up at him. "I'll write you every day. Long letters telling you about boring Georgia and how much I miss Coral Bay. Miss you."

"I'll write back," Danny promised. "Tell you about finishing school, working on cars, how empty the beach feels without you."

"We'll make it work."

"We will," he agreed. Then, quieter: "I'm sorry I almost gave up on us."

"You didn't," I said. "You're still here. That's what matters."

A sound from the gymnasium—cheering, whistling. The last song of the night, probably. The dance was ending.

"I should get home," I said reluctantly. "Before my parents do. If they find my room empty with the door still locked, they'll know something's up."

Danny stood and helped me up. "You're really going to climb back up that trellis?"

"Unless you have a better idea for getting into a locked second-floor bedroom."

"I could talk to your father. Tonight. Explain—"

"No," I said quickly. "Not tonight. Let me have tonight. Tomorrow's soon enough for the consequences."

Danny looked unhappy but nodded. "Be careful. Please."

"I will." I went up on my toes and kissed him one more time. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For staying. For trusting me. For being worth climbing out a window for."

His smile was brilliant even in the dim light. "You're worth it too, Betty Ann Morrison. Worth everything."

Sandy appeared then, keys jangling. "Ready to go? We need to get you home before your parents."

I nodded, reluctant to leave but knowing I had to. "I'll see you soon," I told Danny.

"Soon," he agreed. "And Betty Ann?"

"Yes?"

"I love you."

"I love you too."

Sandy drove us back through the quiet streets. I looked out the window at the familiar town—the hardware store, the church, the diner, all the places I'd known my whole life. Everything looked the same. But I was different.

I'd climbed out a window. I'd chosen love over safety. I'd declared myself publicly.

Tomorrow I'd face my father's anger. The town's gossip. All the consequences of my choice.

But tonight, I'd been brave. And that was enough.

Sandy pulled up to my house—still dark, parents still out. "You sure about the trellis?" she asked.

"I made it down. I can make it back up."

"You're insane. But I love you."

"Love you too." I hugged her quickly and slipped out of the car.

The trellis loomed in the darkness. Higher than I remembered. More intimidating.

But I'd climbed down it once tonight already. I could climb back up.

I found my footing and started climbing, thorns catching my ruined cardigan, my hands protesting. Up past the cracked board. Up through the rose vines. Up toward my open window and the room where I'd spent seventeen years being perfect.

Almost there. Just a little higher. My arms shaking with effort.

Then—headlights in the driveway.

My parents.

I scrambled faster, not caring about the thorns or the noise. Grabbed the window frame and hauled myself through just as the front door opened below.

I tumbled onto my bedroom floor, breathing hard, heart racing. Footsteps on the stairs. My father coming to check on me.

I dove into bed fully clothed, pulled the covers up, and tried to look like I'd been sleeping.

The key turned. The door opened.

My father's silhouette in the doorway, looking in.

"She's asleep," he said quietly to my mother.

The door closed. The key turned.

I lay in the darkness, still wearing my pink polka dot dress, hands scratched and bleeding slightly, cardigan ruined, but safe.

I'd made it.

And tomorrow, I'd face whatever came next with the same courage I'd found tonight.

Because I was done being the good girl who never disappointed anyone.

I was Betty Ann Morrison, and I'd climbed out a window for love.

And I wasn't sorry.

Not even a little bit.
