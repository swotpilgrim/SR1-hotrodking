# Chapter 29: Christmas Dance

The Coral Bay High School Christmas Dance was held two weeks before winter break. The gymnasium was transformed—silver and blue decorations, fake snow dusting the window sills, a massive Christmas tree in the corner twinkling with lights.

Danny picked me up at my house at seven o'clock, wearing a suit jacket I'd never seen before. He looked nervous standing on my porch, flowers in hand.

"These are for you, Mrs. Morrison," he said, handing my mother a bouquet. "And these are for you, Betty Ann." A smaller bouquet of roses.

My mother beamed. My father—who'd been watching from his armchair—actually smiled.

"Have her home by eleven," my father said.

"Yes sir. Absolutely."

"And drive carefully. Roads might be icy."

"I will, sir."

My father stood and walked to the door. He looked at Danny for a long moment, then extended his hand. "Have a good time."

Danny shook his hand, clearly shocked. "Thank you, Mr. Morrison."

In the car—Danny had borrowed his mother's old sedan for the occasion—I touched his arm. "My father shook your hand."

"I know," Danny said, still looking dazed. "I thought I was imagining it."

"You're winning him over."

"Slowly. Very slowly." Danny glanced at me as he drove. "You look beautiful, by the way. Did I mention that?"

I smoothed my new dress—deep blue, purchased with money I'd earned at the hardware store. "You look pretty handsome yourself."

The dance was already crowded when we arrived. Christmas music played from the jukebox—"Jingle Bell Rock" currently thumping through the speakers. Couples danced under the twinkling lights, laughing and spinning.

Sandy waved from across the room, dancing with her boyfriend Tom. She gave me two thumbs up.

Danny led me onto the dance floor, and we joined the chaos of the fast song. I was breathless and laughing by the time it ended.

The next song was slower—"I'll Be Home for Christmas." Danny pulled me close, one hand on my back, our other hands intertwined.

"Remember the sock hop?" I asked.

"Every day," Danny said. "Hard to forget the night Betty Ann Morrison climbed out her window and declared her love in front of half the school."

"Best decision I ever made."

"Even though it caused months of awkwardness and Sunday dinners under your father's suspicious glare?"

"Especially because of that," I said. "We earned this. Every dance, every moment. We fought for it."

Danny spun me out and back in. "I got my midterm grades yesterday."

"And?"

"Straight Bs. And an A in shop class."

I grinned. "Danny! That's amazing!"

"Mrs. Henderson says if I keep it up, I'll definitely graduate in June. Top half of the class even."

"I'm so proud of you."

"I'm proud of us," Danny corrected. "We did this together."

We danced through several more songs. Other couples smiled at us now—no more stares or whispers. We'd become just another couple at the dance. Normal. Accepted.

Rico danced past with his girlfriend and gave Danny a nod of approval. Tommy was there with his date, looking proud of his older brother. Even some of the church youth group girls who'd once been scandalized now smiled politely.

The song changed to "Silver Bells." Danny held me close as we swayed.

"I've been thinking about next year," he said quietly. "After graduation."

"Tell me."

"Mr. Parker at the garage confirmed he'll take me on as an apprentice. Full time, with decent pay. And I've been looking at apartments above shops on Main Street. Nothing fancy, but..." He hesitated. "Maybe in a year or two, I could afford a small place."

"That sounds wonderful."

"And you'll be at art school in Atlanta by then. If you get in."

"When I get in," I corrected. "I'm applying next month. My portfolio is ready."

"It's good, Betty Ann. Really good. They'd be crazy not to accept you."

"It's far," I said. "Atlanta. Four hours away."

"I know." Danny's arms tightened around me slightly. "But we'll make it work. Visits on weekends when we can. Letters the rest of the time. And maybe..." He paused. "Maybe after a year of apprenticing and saving, I could look at opportunities in Atlanta too. Bigger city, more potential customers for a garage."

My heart swelled. "You'd move to Atlanta?"

"If that's where you are," Danny said simply. "I'd move anywhere."

"What about your family?"

"Tommy's sixteen now. Almost able to work full time. Marco's doing well in school. Sarah's... Sarah. They'd be okay. And I could send money home still, help out." He pulled back to look at me. "I don't want us to be limited by geography. I want us to build lives we're proud of. Together."

"Together," I agreed.

The song shifted to something more upbeat. Other couples claimed the floor, energy rising. Danny and I stayed in our own bubble, swaying to our own rhythm.

"Mr. Morrison seems to have softened," Danny observed.

"You won him over. The Sunday dinners, fixing things around the house, asking his advice about business plans. He respects you now."

"I still don't think he loves the idea of his daughter dating me."

"No," I admitted. "But he sees you're serious. That you're working hard. That you treat me well. That's what matters to him."

"And what matters to you?"

I smiled up at him. "You matter to me. This matters. Us, building something real and honest. That's all I need."

Danny kissed my forehead gently—we were still in public, still had to maintain some propriety. But the gesture was tender, full of promise.

We danced until ten-thirty, when Danny glanced at the clock.

"We should head out. Get you home by curfew."

"Always so responsible," I teased.

"I'm not giving your father any reason to change his mind about us," Danny said firmly.

In the car, driving through Coral Bay's decorated streets with Christmas lights twinkling in windows, I felt completely content. This was what I'd fought for. What I'd climbed out that window for.

Not just Danny, though I loved him with everything in me.

But this—the ability to make my own choices. To build my own future. To be brave enough to reach for what I wanted instead of settling for what was safe.

Danny walked me to my door at 10:55 PM exactly.

"Thank you for tonight," I said.

"Thank you for being you," Danny countered. He kissed me goodnight—chaste and sweet, mindful of my parents potentially watching from inside. "See you tomorrow?"

"Church and Sunday dinner," I confirmed. "You're expected."

"Wouldn't miss it."

I floated inside, where my parents were still up reading in the living room.

"Did you have a nice time?" my mother asked.

"Perfect," I said honestly.

My father looked up from his newspaper. "Young man get you home on time?"

"Five minutes early, actually."

My father nodded, seemingly satisfied. "Good."

As I headed upstairs to bed, I heard my mother say to my father: "He's growing on you, isn't he?"

My father's response was too quiet for me to hear. But I thought I caught the words "... suppose he's not entirely terrible..."

I smiled all the way to my room.

Progress. Always progress.

Christmas Eve, Danny's family invited us for dinner. It was the first time my parents had been to the marina district, and I watched my father take in the small houses, the weathered buildings, the working-class neighborhood with new eyes.

Danny's mother, Elena, welcomed us warmly despite the obvious awkwardness. Their house was tiny compared to ours but spotlessly clean. A small Christmas tree stood in the corner, decorated with handmade ornaments.

"Thank you for having us," my mother said, handing Elena a basket of baked goods.

"Thank you for coming," Elena said. "And for... for giving Danny a chance. He's worked so hard this year. You've both been good for each other."

Dinner was simple but delicious—Elena's specialty, she said, stretching ingredients to feed many. Tommy, Sarah, and little Marco were on their best behavior, though Marco's excitement kept bubbling over.

"Danny says you're gonna go to art school," Sarah said to me shyly. "Can you draw horses?"

"I can," I said. "Would you like me to draw you one?"

Her face lit up. I spent an hour after dinner sketching horses for Sarah while the adults talked and Tommy showed my father Danny's hot rod in the garage.

When we left, my father was quiet in the car.

"They're good people," my mother said softly. "Hard-working. Doing their best."

"Yes," my father said. "They are."

He didn't say anything else. But I saw him looking at Danny differently after that. Seeing not just the boy from the wrong side of town, but the boy who'd taken on adult responsibilities at fifteen. Who'd worked himself to exhaustion for his family. Who'd sacrificed his own education until a good girl from the right side of town had shown him another way.

My father was starting to understand what I'd seen all along.

Danny Cole wasn't trouble.

He was brave, and loyal, and worth every risk I'd taken.

And we were building something beautiful together.
