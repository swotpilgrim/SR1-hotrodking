# Chapter 23: Escape Plan

The gymnasium doors loomed ahead, spilling golden light and the cheerful sounds of "Rock Around the Clock" into the warm Florida evening. I smoothed my torn cardigan one more time, feeling the reality of what I'd just done settle over me.

I'd climbed out my bedroom window. I was at the sock hop my father had explicitly forbidden me to attend. There was no going back now.

Sandy touched my arm. "You ready?"

I nodded, not trusting my voice.

We walked through the doors together.

The scene inside was pure 1950s summer magic. Red and white streamers hung from the basketball hoops, twisting gently in the breeze from the doors. Balloons clustered in corners—some had already popped, their deflated remains scattered on the polished gymnasium floor. A massive banner reading "Independence Day Dance 1957" stretched across the far wall, hand-painted letters slightly crooked but cheerful.

The jukebox stood against the wall near the bleachers, currently blasting Little Richard. Couples packed the dance floor—girls in full skirts that spun out like flowers when they twirled, boys in their best button-down shirts and slicked-back hair. The air was thick and warm, smelling of punch and perfume and teenage excitement.

People noticed me immediately.

Betty Ann Morrison. The girl who was supposed to be grounded. The girl whose father had dragged her away from the races. The girl who everyone knew was forbidden from being here.

Whispers started like ripples in water, spreading outward from where I stood.

I lifted my chin and ignored them, scanning the crowd for Danny.

I recognized faces from school, from church, from around town. Sarah Jenkins and Mary Lou from the youth group stood by the punch table, their eyes wide with shock. They nudged each other, pointing. The racing crowd hung out near the bleachers—Frankie and Rico and some others I'd seen at the race. They noticed me and looked confused, then interested.

Sandy stayed close, protective. "Do you see him?"

I shook my head, pushing deeper into the gym. The jukebox switched songs—"Great Balls of Fire" now, the tempo making my already-racing heart beat faster.

I circled the dance floor, checking every corner. Checked the punch table where a teacher stood guard over the beverage. Checked the bleachers where some kids sat out the fast song. Checked near the doors where boys clustered, probably sneaking outside to smoke.

No Danny.

Panic started rising in my chest. What if he wasn't here? What if he'd already left town? What if I'd climbed out my window and risked everything for nothing?

"Excuse me," I said to one of the racing crowd—Rico, I thought his name was. He'd been at the race Saturday. "Have you seen Danny Cole?"

Rico looked uncomfortable, glancing at the girl he was dancing with. "He was here earlier. But he left maybe twenty minutes ago? Headed outside, I think."

My heart sank. "Outside where?"

"Maybe out back? Near the equipment shed?" Rico shrugged. "Don't know for sure."

"Thank you," I said, already turning.

Sandy caught my arm. "Where are you going?"

"Out back. He might be leaving right now." I could hear the desperation in my own voice. "I have to find him before—"

"Go," Sandy said firmly. "I'll stay here in case he comes back inside."

I squeezed her hand gratefully and headed for the back exit.

The gymnasium had two sets of doors—the main entrance where we'd come in, and a back exit near the equipment storage room that led to the parking lot. I'd never used it before, but I'd seen it during school assemblies.

I pushed through the crowd, earning more stares and whispers. A boy from my algebra class did a double-take. One of my mother's friends from church looked scandalized. I didn't care. I had to find Danny.

The back exit doors were propped open slightly, probably for air circulation. I slipped through them into the relative quiet of the parking lot area.

The music was muffled now, just bass thumping through walls. It was darker here, only parking lot lights illuminating scattered cars and the equipment shed about fifty yards away. The air was cooler, carrying the scent of cut grass and gasoline.

And there, leaning against his motorcycle near the shed, was Danny.

Relief hit me so hard I almost stumbled. He was still here. I'd found him.

He wore dark jeans and a white button-down shirt—dressed up for him, I realized. No leather jacket tonight. His duffel bag was strapped to the back of the motorcycle. He really was leaving. He was staring at the school building like he was memorizing it, or saying goodbye.

My breath caught in my throat. This was it. The moment I'd risked everything for.

I started walking toward him, my shoes clicking on the pavement. The sound carried in the quiet, and Danny turned at the noise.

His face when he saw me went through a dozen emotions in seconds—shock, confusion, hope, fear, all at once.

"Betty Ann?" My name came out like a question, like he couldn't believe I was real.

I stopped a few feet away, suddenly uncertain how to start. All the speeches I'd rehearsed evaporated from my mind.

He looked at my torn cardigan. My scratched hands still showing faint bloody lines. My determined but terrified expression.

"What are you doing here?" he asked. "How did you— Your father grounded you. How did you get here?"

"I climbed out my bedroom window," I said, and even to my own ears it sounded absurd.

Danny's eyes went wide. "You what?"

"I climbed out my window." I held up my scratched hands as evidence. "Down the rose trellis. It was twelve feet and one of the boards cracked and I tore my cardigan on the thorns, but I made it."

He stared at me like I'd grown a second head. Betty Ann Morrison—good girl, rule-follower—had climbed out her window?

"You shouldn't have done that," he said, but his voice was rough with emotion. "You're going to get in so much trouble. Your father—"

"I don't care about my father right now," I interrupted. I took a step closer. "I heard you're leaving. That you're leaving town tonight after the dance."

Danny's jaw tightened. He looked away, at his motorcycle, at the duffel bag. "It's better this way."

"Better for who?" The anger in my voice surprised us both. "Not for me."

"Betty Ann—"

"No. You don't get to do this." I moved closer, close enough that he had to look at me. "You don't get to decide what's better for me. That's what my father does. That's what everyone has done my whole life. I thought you were different."

"I'm trying to protect you," Danny said, and I could hear the pain in his voice. "You're grounded indefinitely because of me. Your reputation—"

"I don't care about my reputation!" The words burst out louder than I intended. "I care about you. I care about us. I care about making my own choices instead of letting everyone else decide my life for me."

Danny shook his head. "You should care. You have a future. College, art school, a real life. I'm just—" He gestured at himself, at the run-down marina district visible beyond the school. "I'm nobody. I've got nothing to offer you except struggle and being looked down on."

"You're not nobody," I said fiercely. "You work harder than anyone I know. You're taking care of your entire family at eighteen. You're smart and loyal and kind. You see me, Danny. The real me, not just the perfect daughter everyone expects. That's not nothing."

"Your father's right about me," Danny said quietly. "I am trouble. Look at you—you climbed out a window. You're sneaking to a dance you're forbidden from. You're lying to your parents. That's not who you are."

"Maybe it is who I am," I said. "Maybe I've been pretending to be someone else my whole life. Someone small and obedient and perfect. But I don't want to be that person anymore. I want to be brave enough to choose what I want. And I want you."

The words hung between us in the warm night air.

Danny's expression was tortured. "I love you," he said, and my heart stuttered at hearing it out loud for the first time. "But I love you too much to watch you destroy your future for me. If I stay, you'll lose everything."

"If you leave, I lose myself," I countered. My eyes were filling with tears but I didn't care. "Don't you understand? Staying silent and small and scared—that's what destroys me. Not you. Never you."

"Betty Ann—"

I closed the last few feet between us. "I'm not asking you to save me or protect me or make decisions for me. I'm asking you to trust me. Trust that I know my own heart. Trust that I'm strong enough to handle whatever comes."

Danny's hand came up like he wanted to touch me but was afraid to. "What if I can't give you what you need?"

"You already give me what I need," I said softly. "You make me brave. You make me want to fight for myself. You make me believe I'm worth fighting for."

We were standing so close now I could feel the heat radiating from him. Could see the conflict in his eyes—wanting to stay, scared to hurt me, terrified of both options.

"I climbed out my window for you," I said. "I defied my father. I risked everything to come here tonight. Don't let that be for nothing. Don't leave."

"Your father will make your life hell," Danny said.

"Then we'll face it together," I said. "But we'll face it. Not run from it."

Behind us, someone had opened the gymnasium doors wider. Music poured out—"Earth Angel," slow and romantic. The sound of the dance, of life, of possibility.

Danny's hand finally touched my face, gentle despite his callused fingers. "You're sure? You're really sure about this? About me?"

"I've never been more sure of anything in my life," I said.

And before he could argue anymore, before he could sacrifice himself again, before he could talk himself into leaving—I kissed him.

It wasn't gentle or tentative like I'd imagined a first kiss would be. It was fierce and desperate and claiming. I kissed him like I meant it, like I was choosing him, like I was choosing myself.

For one shocked second, Danny froze. Then his arms came around me and he was kissing me back with equal intensity. His hand in my hair, my hands fisted in his shirt, the world narrowing to just this—us, together, fighting for each other.

When we finally broke apart, both breathless, Danny rested his forehead against mine.

"I love you," he whispered again. "God help me, I love you."

"I love you too," I whispered back. The words felt like freedom. Like truth. Like coming home.

A sound made me turn, still in Danny's arms. I became aware of movement, voices. We were no longer alone.

A group of kids had come outside—some who'd heard raised voices, others just taking a break from the dance. They stood in the doorway and scattered across the parking lot, watching. Staring at Betty Ann Morrison kissing Danny Cole behind the gymnasium.

I recognized faces in the dim light. Rico and his date. Sandy, who must have followed me out. Tommy—Danny's brother, who'd been inside the dance. Some girls from church youth group. Other classmates.

People who would talk. People who would tell. By tomorrow, everyone in Coral Bay would know.

My father would definitely find out now.

But as I stood there in Danny's arms, with witnesses watching, I realized I didn't feel panic.

I felt power.

Let them watch. Let them talk. Let them tell.

I was done hiding.
