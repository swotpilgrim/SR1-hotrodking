# Chapter 28: First Sunday Dinner

The following Sunday came too quickly and not quickly enough.

I changed outfits three times before settling on a simple yellow sundress—nice enough for Sunday dinner but not trying too hard. My hands shook as I applied lipstick.

"He'll be here any minute," my mother called from downstairs.

I took a deep breath and headed down.

My father sat in his armchair reading the newspaper. He'd barely spoken to me all week beyond necessary conversation. My mother bustled in the kitchen, cooking enough food for an army despite there being only four of us for dinner.

The doorbell rang at exactly five o'clock.

Danny stood on our front porch in clean khakis and a button-down shirt I'd never seen before. His hair was combed back neatly. He held a small bouquet of flowers.

"Mr. Morrison, Mrs. Morrison," he said politely. "Thank you for inviting me to dinner."

My father grunted. My mother smiled nervously. "Come in, Danny. Please."

Danny handed my mother the flowers. "My mother grows these in our garden. She thought you might like them."

"Oh!" My mother looked genuinely touched. "How thoughtful. I'll put these in water."

I met Danny's eyes across the living room. He looked terrified but determined. I tried to convey with my expression: You can do this.

"Sit down, young man," my father said, folding his newspaper with deliberate slowness.

Danny sat on the sofa. I sat beside him, maintaining a proper distance.

My father studied Danny like he was a particularly troublesome math problem. "Betty Ann tells me you've enrolled for fall classes."

"Yes sir. Full schedule. Mrs. Henderson is my advisor. She's helping me stay on track for graduation."

"And your job at the marina?"

"I've arranged to work evening shifts only during the school year. Weekends during the day."

"That's a lot," my father observed.

"I'm used to it, sir."

"And your family? Your mother and siblings?"

"They're doing well. My mother got more hours at the diner. Tommy's helping more with the younger ones. We're managing."

My father nodded slowly. "Mrs. Henderson speaks highly of you."

"She's been very supportive, sir."

"She says you passed algebra with distinction. Thanks to Betty Ann's tutoring."

"Betty Ann's an excellent teacher," Danny said, glancing at me with a small smile. "She made the concepts make sense."

"What are your plans after graduation?" my father asked. "Assuming you do graduate this time."

"I will graduate," Danny said firmly. "After that, I'm planning to apprentice with Ed Parker at Parker's Garage. He's willing to train me properly in auto mechanics. In a few years, I hope to open my own shop."

"That requires capital."

"I'm saving, sir. Every extra dollar. It'll take time, but I'll get there."

My father leaned back in his chair. "And where does my daughter fit into these plans?"

Danny met his eyes steadily. "Wherever she wants to fit, sir. Betty Ann has her own dreams—art school, her own career. I'm not asking her to give up anything for me. I'm asking to build a future alongside her. When we're both ready."

"You're eighteen years old. You don't know what you want."

"With respect, sir, I know I want to be someone Betty Ann can be proud of. Someone who earns your respect. Someone who proves he's worth her faith in him."

My father studied him for another long moment.

"Dinner's ready!" my mother called from the dining room.

We moved to the table. My mother had indeed cooked enough for an army—pot roast, mashed potatoes, green beans, rolls, salad. Danny's eyes widened at the spread.

"This is amazing, Mrs. Morrison," he said. "Thank you so much."

"It's our pleasure, Danny." My mother beamed, already won over.

We ate in initially awkward silence. Then my mother asked Danny about his siblings, and he told funny stories about Tommy's antics and Sarah's horse obsession. My mother laughed, and even my father's lips twitched slightly.

"Betty Ann tells me you're quite skilled with cars," my mother ventured.

"I enjoy working with my hands," Danny said. "There's something satisfying about taking something broken and making it work again."

"My car's been making a strange noise," my mother said. "Maybe after dinner you could take a look?"

"I'd be happy to, ma'am."

After dinner, Danny did indeed look at my mother's car while I "helped" by standing nearby and talking to him.

"You're doing great," I whispered.

"Your father hates me," Danny whispered back.

"He doesn't hate you. He's just... cautious."

Danny found the problem with my mother's car—a loose belt. He tightened it with tools from our garage. My mother was delighted.

"You're a lifesaver, Danny! My husband's been saying he'd fix that for weeks."

My father, who'd come outside to supervise, looked grudgingly impressed.

By the time Danny left at seven o'clock sharp (respecting curfew), my mother was singing his praises.

"Such a polite young man! And so helpful with the car. And those stories about his siblings—he clearly cares deeply about his family."

My father said nothing. But when I looked at him, he wasn't frowning quite as deeply as before.

***

The summer settled into a new rhythm. Danny came for Sunday dinners every week. He was never late, always polite, always respectful. He fixed things around our house without being asked—the squeaky screen door, the loose railing on the porch, the stuck window in the kitchen.

My father watched him like a hawk. But gradually, grudgingly, I saw his expression soften.

One Sunday in August, after Danny had spent an hour helping my father reorganize the tool shed, I overhead them talking.

"You know your way around tools," my father said.

"My father taught me before he died," Danny said. "He said a man should know how to fix things."

"He taught you well."

"Thank you, sir."

A pause. Then my father: "What's your plan for this garage you want to open?"

And they talked—actually talked—about business plans and start-up costs and building a customer base. My father asked questions. Danny answered them thoughtfully.

When I walked outside with lemonade, they were bent over a notepad, my father sketching something while Danny pointed and explained.

They looked up at the same time. My father cleared his throat awkwardly. Danny smiled.

"Your father's giving me some advice on business planning," Danny said.

"Just basic common sense," my father said gruffly. "Nothing special."

But it was special. It was my father seeing Danny as more than just the boy from the marina district. Seeing him as someone with plans, with ambition, with potential.

It was progress.

***

In September, school started. Danny was in several of my classes—he'd tested into advanced placement thanks to all the catching up he'd done over the summer. Teachers commented on how focused he'd become. How different from the sullen, barely-passing boy he'd been before.

We studied together at the public library, properly supervised. We held hands walking to class. We ate lunch together in the cafeteria, no longer caring about the stares or whispers.

Most of the talk had died down anyway. After the initial scandal, Coral Bay had moved on to other gossip. We were old news.

One October afternoon, Mrs. Henderson stopped me after class.

"I wanted to tell you I'm proud of you," she said. "Both of you. You've shown real maturity in how you've handled this."

"Thank you, Mrs. Henderson. And thank you for believing in us."

"I saw potential in both of you from the start," she said. "I'm glad you saw it in each other."

I realized she'd orchestrated our tutoring session on purpose. She'd known exactly what might happen.

"You knew," I said. "When you assigned Danny to tutor with me. You knew."

Mrs. Henderson's smile was mysterious. "I knew you both needed exactly what the other could offer. The rest was up to you."

My eighteenth birthday came in November. Danny took me to dinner at the nicest restaurant in Coral Bay—well, the only real restaurant beyond the diner. He'd saved for weeks to afford it.

"I have something for you," he said after dessert. He handed me a small wrapped box.

Inside was a delicate silver bracelet with a single charm—a tiny ladder.

"For climbing out windows," Danny said, his eyes warm. "For being brave."

I fastened it around my wrist, tears in my eyes. "I love it. I love you."

"I love you too. Happy birthday, Betty Ann Morrison. Now officially an adult who can make all her own choices."

"I choose you," I said. "Every time."

We drove to Palmetto Beach afterward, our spot where everything had started. Sat on the sand watching the waves under the stars.

"One more year," Danny said. "Then we both graduate. Then we start our real lives."

"Together," I said.

"Together," he agreed.

He pulled me close, and I rested my head on his shoulder, the silver bracelet catching the moonlight.

We'd fought for this. Climbed windows and faced fathers and proved ourselves worthy of each other's trust.

And we'd won.

Not easily. Not perfectly.

But honestly, bravely, together.

And that was everything.
