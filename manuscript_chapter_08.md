# Chapter 8: Moving to the Beach

The Sunday before our Tuesday session, I lay awake past midnight thinking about the library. About Mrs. Kowalski's disapproving glares and the oppressive quiet that made even whispered conversations feel like shouting. About how Danny's shoulders were always tense there, hunched defensively like he expected judgment at any moment.

About how different he'd been Thursday when we'd talked more freely, when the conversation had flowed naturally between algebra problems. He'd been relaxed. Present. Actually himself instead of the defensive version he showed the world.

The library was wrong for what we were trying to do. Too formal, too rigid, too full of watchful eyes. Danny needed somewhere he could breathe.

By Monday afternoon, I'd made my decision.

Tuesday found me at the library at one forty-five as usual, but this time I didn't spread my materials across the table. Instead, I waited in the lobby, watching the door. When Danny walked in at exactly two o'clock—three sessions in a row now, I noted with quiet pride—I intercepted him before he could head to our usual spot.

"I have an idea," I said. "A suggestion, actually. About where we should study."

Danny raised an eyebrow. "I thought you liked the library. All organized and proper."

"I did." I clutched my bag tighter, suddenly nervous. What if he thought this was a terrible idea? What if it seemed too forward, too presumptuous? "But I've been thinking. You focus better when you're relaxed, and this place is..." I gestured at Mrs. Kowalski, who was already glaring at us from the circulation desk. "Not relaxing."

"You can say that again," Danny muttered.

"So I thought we could try Palmetto Beach instead. It's quiet there, less crowded than the main beach. We could work outside, get some fresh air." I rushed through the words before I could lose my nerve. "The tutoring would still be happening, just in a different location. If you think it's a bad idea, we can stay here, I just thought—"

"That's a great idea," Danny interrupted, and his face broke into a genuine smile. The kind that made him look younger, less burdened. "Seriously, Betty Ann. The beach sounds perfect."

Relief flooded through me. "Really? You don't think it's... unprofessional or something?"

"I think studying is studying, whether we're in a stuffy library or outside." He glanced at Mrs. Kowalski, who was still watching us with pinched disapproval. "And I definitely focus better without her staring at me like I'm about to steal the books."

"Thursday, then?" I said. "Two o'clock at Palmetto Beach? There's parking off Ocean Drive, and we can set up near the palm trees."

"I'll be there." Danny's smile widened. "Color me impressed, Betty Ann Morrison. Didn't think you had it in you to break your own rules."

Heat crept up my neck. "I'm not breaking rules. I'm... adapting the structure for better educational outcomes."

"Sure." His eyes sparkled with amusement. "That's exactly what you're doing."

"It is," I insisted, but I was fighting a smile.

"Whatever you say." He adjusted his bag on his shoulder. "So, no session today?"

"Not here. But I brought cookies." I pulled out the container of peanut butter cookies I'd made. "Consider it a preview of the new study arrangement."

Danny's expression softened as he took the container. "You made these?"

"I made too many. Again." The lie came easier this time. "Seemed a shame to waste them."

"Right. Too many." But the way he said it, the knowing warmth in his voice, suggested he saw right through me. "Thanks, Betty Ann."

"See you Thursday," I said, and walked out before I could second-guess myself.

Thursday afternoon, I parked my father's borrowed Ford on Ocean Drive and carried my supplies down to the beach. Palmetto Beach stretched before me, quieter than the main tourist stretch. White sand, gentle waves, the ocean sparkling turquoise in the afternoon sun. Palm trees clustered near the dunes, providing patches of shade.

I'd brought our old family beach blanket—faded blue and white stripes, soft from years of use. I spread it under a particularly large palm, arranging textbooks and notebooks and the lunch I'd packed. Two roast beef sandwiches, lemonade, and more cookies because Danny had demolished the ones I'd given him Tuesday.

The sound of a motorcycle engine announced Danny's arrival. I watched him park at the edge of the lot, pulling off his helmet and running a hand through his dark hair. He was in jeans and a white t-shirt instead of the leather jacket—too hot for that in the Florida summer humidity. The shirt showed his arms, tanned and muscled from dock work. I looked away quickly, busying myself with the textbook.

"This is nice," Danny said, dropping down on the blanket beside me. Not across from me, like at the library table. Beside me. Close enough that I could smell motor oil and soap and something else—sunlight, maybe, or salt air. "Really nice. Good call."

"I thought the change of scenery might help." I handed him a sandwich without preamble. "And yes, I made too much again."

"You're a terrible liar." But he took it gratefully, unwrapping the wax paper. "Not complaining, though."

We ate in comfortable silence, watching the waves roll in. A few other beachgoers dotted the sand—families with children, a couple of teenagers throwing a football—but they were far enough away to give us privacy. The breeze was warm and steady, carrying the scent of salt and sunscreen.

"Okay," I said when we'd finished eating. "Ready to work?"

"Hit me with your worst."

I'd prepared problems about velocity and trajectory—relevant to his racing, I hoped. Danny stretched out on his stomach, propped on his elbows with the notebook in front of him. His posture was completely relaxed, nothing like the tense wariness of the library.

"So if you're approaching a turn at sixty miles per hour," I began, "and you need to decelerate at a constant rate to hit thirty miles per hour at the apex of the curve..."

"That's a ratio problem," Danny said immediately. "And I need to figure out the time and distance, right?"

"Exactly."

We worked through the problem together, Danny's pencil moving confidently across the page. When he got stuck, he didn't shut down defensively. He just asked questions. And when he got it right—which was most of the time now—his face lit up with genuine satisfaction.

"This makes sense," he said after solving a particularly complex problem. "Like, actually makes sense. When Mrs. Henderson just throws formulas at us, it's meaningless. But when you explain it with real stuff, things I actually do, I can see how it works."

Pride swelled in my chest. "You're learning. That's what matters."

"You're a good teacher." He looked up at me, squinting slightly against the sun. "Better than you give yourself credit for."

"I'm learning too," I admitted. "How to explain things differently. How to find the right angle for each concept."

We worked through three more problems before Danny's concentration started to waver. I could tell from the way his gaze drifted to the water, the way his pencil stilled mid-calculation.

"Break time," I announced.

"I should finish this one—"

"Break time," I repeated firmly. "Your brain needs rest or nothing will stick."

Danny grinned and rolled onto his back, arms behind his head. "Yes, ma'am."

I pulled out my sketchbook, intending to make notes on which concepts we'd covered and what to tackle next. But instead, I found myself sketching the beachscape—the curve of the shore, the palm fronds overhead, the way the light caught the water.

"Want to walk?" Danny asked suddenly.

I looked up, surprised. "Walk?"

"Yeah. Down to the water. Skip some stones." He pushed himself up, brushing sand off his jeans. "Come on. All work and no play makes Betty Ann a dull girl."

"I am not dull," I protested, but I was already standing, leaving my shoes beside the blanket.

The sand was warm beneath my bare feet, almost hot near the dunes but cooling as we approached the water. The waves lapped gently at the shore, barely more than ripples. Danny walked beside me, close enough that our arms occasionally brushed. Each contact sent a little jolt through me that I tried to ignore.

"Watch this," Danny said, bending to select a flat stone from the wet sand. He wound up and released it with a practiced flick of his wrist. The stone skipped across the water—one, two, three, four times before sinking.

"Show off," I said.

"Your turn." He handed me a stone, his fingers warm against mine for just a second.

I tried to mimic his throwing motion. The stone plunked into the water without skipping once.

Danny laughed—a real, unguarded laugh that made him look entirely different from the defensive boy I'd first met. "That was terrible."

"Thanks so much for your support."

"Here, let me show you." He moved behind me, reaching around to adjust my arm position. "See, you've got to release it at the right angle. Low and fast, not high."

I was intensely aware of his proximity—his chest close to my back, his arm guiding mine, his breath stirring my hair. My heart hammered so loud I was sure he could hear it.

"Like this," he said, his hand covering mine on the stone. "Feel the angle?"

I felt something, but I wasn't sure it was the angle. "I think so."

"Okay, now throw."

We threw together, his hand guiding mine through the motion. The stone left my palm and—miracle of miracles—skipped twice before sinking.

"You did it!" Danny's voice was warm with pride, still close to my ear.

"We did it," I corrected, suddenly very aware that I should probably step away but not actually wanting to move.

Danny seemed to realize the same thing. He stepped back quickly, leaving me feeling oddly cold despite the summer heat. "You're a natural."

"Hardly." But I was smiling, reaching for another stone. "Again?"

We spent twenty minutes skipping stones, Danny patiently coaching my terrible technique into something almost competent. He told me about racing while we threw—the upcoming Fourth of July competition he was preparing for, the modifications he'd made to his hot rod, the rush of speed and freedom.

"It's the only time I don't think about anything else," he said, sending a stone flying across the water with impressive distance. "When I'm racing, I'm not worried about rent or my siblings or school or any of it. It's just me and the car and the road."

"That sounds incredible," I said honestly.

"It is." He glanced at me. "You should come watch sometime. The race, I mean. If you wanted to."

The invitation hung between us, weighted with something more than casual friendliness. If I went to watch Danny race, it would be a statement. Everyone in Coral Bay knew about the races. Going would mean publicly associating with him outside of tutoring, choosing to be in his world.

"Maybe," I said, not quite ready to commit but not wanting to shut the door completely. "Maybe I will."

Danny's smile was reward enough.

We walked back to the blanket, and I settled cross-legged on the sun-warmed fabric while Danny lay on his side, propped on one elbow. The relaxed position should have seemed lazy, but somehow it just made him look comfortable. At ease in a way I'd never seen him at school or the library.

"Your turn," I said, pulling out my sketchbook to make notes about our next session.

"My turn for what?"

"To learn." I caught his eye. "You can't spend the whole session just being my student. Tell me something I don't know."

Danny thought for a moment, then launched into an explanation of how carburetors worked, his hands moving expressively as he described fuel mixtures and air flow. I found myself genuinely interested, not just in the mechanics but in watching him talk about something he loved. His whole demeanor changed—the defensive edge disappeared, replaced by enthusiasm and expertise.

A sketch started forming on my page without conscious thought: Danny's hands moving as he talked, the concentration on his face, the way the afternoon light caught his profile.

"Are you drawing me?" Danny asked suddenly, interrupting his own explanation.

I looked down at my sketchbook, startled. "I—sorry. It's just a habit. I draw when I'm listening."

"Can I see?"

Every instinct said to say no, to hide the page. But we'd been honest with each other so far. Slowly, I turned the sketchbook toward him.

Danny studied it for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then he looked up at me with something I couldn't quite name in his eyes. "You're really talented, Betty Ann. Seriously talented."

"It's just a sketch."

"No." He was firm, certain. "It's more than that. This is what you should be studying. This is what you should be doing with your life."

"My father—"

"Your father's wrong." Danny said it without hesitation. "I know you love him and respect him, but he's wrong about this. You have real talent. Gift, even. Hiding it because it's not 'practical' is like... like if someone told me I couldn't race anymore because it's too dangerous. It's part of who you are."

His words hit something deep inside me, a truth I'd been avoiding. "It's not that simple."

"I know." His voice softened. "Believe me, I know. Family obligations, expectations, trying to be what everyone needs you to be—I get it. But Betty Ann..." He paused, seeming to choose his words carefully. "Don't lose yourself trying to please everyone else. That's a really easy way to wake up at thirty and realize you don't know who you are anymore."

I stared at him, this boy who barely knew me, who somehow saw straight to the heart of my deepest fear. "When did you get so wise?"

"When my dad died and I had to grow up overnight." The words were matter-of-fact, but I heard the weight behind them. "I didn't get a choice about my path. But you do, Betty Ann. And I think you should fight for what you want."

"Even if it means disappointing people?"

"Especially then." He held my gaze. "You can't live your whole life afraid of disappointment."

We sat in silence for a moment, the waves providing a gentle soundtrack. The conversation felt important, significant in a way I couldn't fully articulate. Danny had seen my art and validated it, encouraged it, in a way my parents never had. The gift of that recognition made my chest feel tight and warm simultaneously.

"We should probably get back to algebra," I said finally, not because I wanted to but because the intensity of the moment was becoming overwhelming.

"Probably." But Danny didn't move immediately. "This was good, though. The beach. The talk. All of it."

"Yeah," I agreed softly. "It was."

We worked through the remaining problems as the afternoon stretched toward evening, the quality of light shifting from bright afternoon to golden pre-sunset. Danny's focus remained sharp, his understanding growing with each problem. By the time we packed up, we'd covered more material than any three library sessions combined.

"Same time next week?" Danny asked as we walked back to the parking lot, our arms full of books and blankets.

"Tuesday and Thursday," I confirmed. "Here at the beach."

"Perfect." He loaded his books into the motorcycle's saddlebag, then paused. "Thanks, Betty Ann. For suggesting this. For..." He gestured vaguely. "Everything, I guess."

"You're welcome." I felt suddenly shy, aware that something had shifted between us today. We'd crossed another invisible line, moved deeper into territory that was definitely no longer just tutoring. "See you Tuesday."

"See you Tuesday."

I watched him ride away, the motorcycle's engine fading into the distance. Then I loaded my own car and sat for a moment in the driver's seat, processing.

The beach had been the right choice. Danny had been relaxed, open, more himself than I'd ever seen him. We'd laughed together. Talked about real things. The walls he kept up were coming down, and I was seeing the person underneath—thoughtful, passionate, surprisingly insightful.

And I'd let my own walls down too. Shown him my art, admitted my dreams, let him see past the perfect daughter to the person I actually was.

It should have terrified me. Instead, it felt like relief.

I drove home through the warm evening, already planning Tuesday's session. Already looking forward to two more hours on that sun-warmed blanket, algebra and conversation and the sound of waves in the background.

Already knowing that what was happening between Danny Cole and me was becoming something more complicated and more real than simple tutoring.

And for the first time in my carefully controlled life, I wasn't afraid of complicated.
