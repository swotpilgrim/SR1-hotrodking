# Chapter 27: Public Commitment

I spent the rest of Saturday in my room, alternating between packing for Georgia and staring out my window at the rose trellis I'd climbed twice in one night.

Sandy called around noon. My mother answered, her voice cool. "Betty Ann can't come to the phone right now."

I heard Sandy's protests, but my mother was firm. "I'll tell her you called." Click.

Another call came an hour later. This time my father answered. His voice was sharp: "No, she cannot speak with you, young man. And you're not to contact her again. Do I make myself clear?"

Danny. My heart ached.

I considered climbing out the window again—during the day this time. But where would I go? My father would just track me down, and it would make everything worse.

So I sat. And waited. And wrote letters I couldn't send yet.

Around three o'clock, there was a knock at the front door. I heard my father answer, then his voice rising: "You have a lot of nerve showing up at my house—"

"Mr. Morrison, please. I just want to talk." Danny's voice. He'd come here.

I flew to my bedroom door, pressing my ear against it.

"There's nothing to discuss," my father said. "You're to stay away from my daughter."

"Sir, I understand you're angry—"

"Angry? I'm furious. You've corrupted my daughter. Turned her into someone who lies and sneaks around and—"

"I didn't corrupt her," Danny interrupted, his voice respectful but firm. "Betty Ann made her own choices. She's stronger and braver than you give her credit for."

"Don't tell me about my own daughter."

"Then listen to her," Danny said. "Really listen. Not just hear what you want to hear, but listen to what she's trying to tell you."

A pause. Then my father: "I'm sending her to Georgia. Today if I can arrange it. You won't see her again."

"Then I'll wait," Danny said simply. "She turns eighteen in November. I'll wait."

"You're delusional if you think this infatuation will last—"

"It's not an infatuation, sir. I love your daughter. And I'm going to prove to you that I'm worth her faith in me. I'm finishing school—really finishing this time. I'm working hard. I'm going to make something of myself."

"You're from the marina district. You have no prospects, no future—"

"I have a future if I build one," Danny said. "And Betty Ann makes me want to build it. She makes me want to be better. Isn't that what love should do?"

Silence.

Then my father, quieter: "She climbed out a window. For you."

"I know," Danny said, and I could hear the awe in his voice. "She's the bravest person I've ever met."

"She's reckless. She could have been hurt."

"She's brave," Danny corrected. "There's a difference. And sir, with respect—she's reckless because you've never let her make her own mistakes. Never trusted her to handle consequences. She's spent seventeen years being perfect, and she's suffocating."

Another long silence.

"Get off my property," my father said finally. "Before I call the sheriff."

"Yes sir," Danny said. "But Mr. Morrison? Betty Ann's worth fighting for. And I'm going to fight for her. Every day. Whether you approve or not."

The door closed. Footsteps retreating.

I slumped against my bedroom door, tears streaming down my face. He'd come. He'd stood up to my father. He'd fought for me.

I scribbled another letter, quick and messy:

*Danny - You came to my house. You faced my father. You're the bravest person I know. I love you. I'll write every day from Georgia. Wait for me. - BA*

An hour later, Sandy appeared at my window. Actually at my window, having climbed the trellis herself.

I threw it open, shocked. "Sandy!"

"Your parents won't let me in the front door," she said, climbing through. "So I improvised." She brushed rose petals off her skirt. "That trellis is treacherous."

I hugged her fiercely.

"I brought you something," Sandy said, pulling envelopes from her purse. "Three letters. From Danny. Your father refused to let him give them to you, so he gave them to me to smuggle in."

I grabbed the letters like they were oxygen. "Thank you thank you thank you."

"There's something else," Sandy said. "Half the town is talking about last night. And Betty Ann? They're not all condemning you."

I looked up from Danny's handwriting on the envelope. "What?"

"Some of the girls from school think you're incredibly romantic. And brave. Mary Patterson—Margaret's daughter—told her mother she was being a judgmental busybody. There was a huge fight at their house apparently."

Despite everything, I smiled. "Really?"

"Really. And Mrs. Henderson stopped by the hardware store this morning. Told your father she thought you and Danny were good for each other. That you'd helped Danny pass algebra and he'd helped you find your courage."

"What did my father say?"

"According to my mom who was there buying paint, he said it was none of her business. But he looked... I don't know. Thoughtful."

"I'm still going to Georgia," I said. "My father's not budging."

Sandy hugged me again. "Then we'll write. Every week. And when you turn eighteen in November, you come right back. Okay?"

"Okay."

She climbed back out my window, nimble as a cat. I watched her descend the trellis, then turned to Danny's letters.

I opened the first one:

*Betty Ann-*

*I can't stop thinking about last night. About your courage. About your kiss. About the way you stood in that parking lot and chose us in front of everyone.*

*Your father came to the door today. He won't let me see you or talk to you. He says you're going to Georgia. But I don't care. I'll wait. However long it takes.*

*I'm going back to school in the fall. Really trying this time. I'm going to graduate, get my diploma, make you proud. And then I'm going to save every penny until I can come to wherever you are.*

*You climbed out a window for me. I can wait a few months for you.*

*I love you. Every day. Always.*

*- Danny*

The second letter was shorter:

*Betty Ann-*

*Mrs. Henderson stopped by the garage today. She said she's proud of both of us. That we've both grown into who we're supposed to be.*

*She also said your father looked 'conflicted' when she talked to him. Whatever that means.*

*Missing you already.*

*- D*

The third letter made me cry:

*Betty Ann-*

*I asked my mother what she thought about us. About you. She said any girl brave enough to climb out a window to chase me down is exactly the kind of girl I should marry someday.*

*Marry. Someday. When we're old enough and ready and have built something together.*

*I'm keeping that word in my heart.*

*Wait for me while I prove I'm worth waiting for.*

*All my love,*
*Danny*

I held the letters to my chest and lay on my bed, staring at my ceiling.

Marry. Someday.

The word made my heart soar and terrify me in equal measure.

But yes. Someday.

After I'd been to art school. After he'd graduated and started his garage. After we'd built lives we were proud of.

Someday, we'd have this. Together. Honestly. Bravely.

All we had to do was wait.

And fight.

And trust that love was worth both.

Sunday morning, I dressed for church in my most conservative dress. My father looked surprised when I came downstairs.

"I'm still going to church," I said. "Even if I'm in disgrace."

He nodded slowly. "Good."

At church, the whispers were deafening. Everyone knew. Mrs. Patterson sat in her usual pew, looking satisfied with herself. Her daughter Mary sat as far from her as possible, shooting me an apologetic look.

During the service, Reverend Harper spoke about forgiveness and understanding. About how love required courage. About how judging others was easier than examining our own hearts.

I wondered if my father was listening.

After the service, Mrs. Henderson approached us in the parking lot. "Walter, Helen," she greeted my parents. "Betty Ann."

"Mrs. Henderson," my father said stiffly.

"I wanted you to know that Danny Cole has enrolled for the fall semester," she said. "Full course load. He's determined to graduate properly this time."

"That's... good," my father said, clearly not sure how to respond.

"He's a good boy," Mrs. Henderson continued. "Hard worker. Smart when he applies himself. I think Betty Ann's been good for him." She paused meaningfully. "And he's been good for her."

"Mrs. Henderson—" my father started.

"I'm not condoning rule-breaking," she interrupted. "But I am saying that sometimes young people surprise us. Sometimes they show us courage we didn't know they had. Sometimes they teach us that love doesn't fit in neat little boxes of what's appropriate or expected."

She walked away, leaving my parents stunned.

My mother touched my father's arm. "Walter..."

"Don't," he said. But his voice was uncertain. Not angry. Just... uncertain.

We drove home in silence.

That evening, my father called me into his study.

"Sit," he said.

I sat.

He looked at me for a long moment. Really looked at me. "Your mother says I've been too hard on you. Too controlling."

I said nothing, waiting.

"She says that you're not a little girl anymore. That you're almost eighteen. That I need to trust you to make your own choices." He sighed. "I don't want to. I want to keep you safe. Keep you from making mistakes."

"I know," I said quietly.

"But Mrs. Henderson is right. You have shown courage. And this boy—this Danny Cole—he did stand up to me. He did promise to prove himself." My father ran his hand through his hair. "I don't like him. I don't approve of this relationship. But..."

"But?" My heart was pounding.

"But maybe your mother's right. Maybe sending you to Georgia isn't the answer. Maybe the answer is trusting you to handle the consequences of your choices. And watching to see if this boy is serious about proving himself."

I couldn't breathe. "You're saying I don't have to go to Georgia?"

"I'm saying..." My father struggled with the words. "I'm saying you can stay in Coral Bay. Finish your senior year here. On one condition."

"What condition?"

"If this boy wants to court you, he does it properly. Sunday dinners here. No sneaking around. Curfew strictly enforced. And he maintains good grades and graduation track."

"And if he does all that?" I asked carefully.

"Then I'll... try. To accept him. To see what you see in him." My father's expression was pained. "I don't promise I'll approve. But I'll try to be fair."

It wasn't everything. It wasn't full approval or blessing.

But it was a chance. A real chance.

"Thank you," I whispered.

My father nodded curtly. "Don't make me regret this."

"I won't."

I ran upstairs and immediately started writing to Danny:

*I'm not going to Georgia. My father's giving us a chance...*

The words poured out, hope and joy and relief mixing together.

We had a chance. A real, honest chance.

All we had to do was prove we were worth it.

And I knew we were.
