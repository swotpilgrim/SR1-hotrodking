# Chapter 22: Betty Ann's Choice

I woke Wednesday morning knowing I'd reached my limit.

Two days trapped in my room except for supervised shifts at the hardware store. Two days of my father's disapproving silence and my mother's worried glances. Two days feeling the walls close in, suffocating me under the weight of their expectations.

The obedient part of me—the part that had spent seventeen years being perfect—wanted to submit. Accept the punishment. Let things settle. Wait for my parents' anger to fade.

But something harder in me refused.

I hadn't endured weeks of secret meetings, hadn't risked everything at that race, hadn't fallen in love with Danny Cole just to give up because my father said no. If I did, what was any of it for?

I sat up in bed and looked at myself in the mirror across the room. The morning light caught my reflection—Betty Ann Morrison, good daughter, straight-A student, church volunteer. The girl who never disappointed anyone.

Except now I saw two possible futures reflected back. One where I obeyed and lost myself. One where I fought and possibly lost everything else.

The choice crystallized with perfect clarity.

I was going to the sock hop Friday night. I was finding Danny. I wasn't letting him leave without a fight.

The decision settled into my bones like certainty. It should have terrified me. Instead, I felt steady for the first time in days.

I spent Wednesday planning. Methodically, the way I approached everything. If I was going to defy my father, I'd do it right.

My parents would be at the church social committee meeting Friday evening—they'd mentioned it last week before everything imploded. They wouldn't take me now that I'd disgraced myself, but they'd still attend. Appearances mattered too much not to.

My father would probably lock my bedroom door from the outside. He'd done it Tuesday night, the key turning in the lock like a prison sentence.

I examined my window during my brief moments alone. Second floor. The drop looked terrifying. But my mother's climbing roses grew on a trellis against the house, right below my window. The trellis was old but seemed sturdy. Risky, but possible.

I'd need Sandy's help. Transportation and cover. But how could I get a message to her when I was essentially under house arrest?

Thursday morning at the hardware store, I watched the sidewalk through the front window while restocking nails. My father worked in the back office, but I could feel his presence like a weight.

Then—like an answer to a prayer I'd been too scared to voice—Sandy walked past on the sidewalk.

My heart jumped. I caught her eye through the window and gestured desperately.

Sandy's eyebrows rose. She glanced around, then pushed through the front door, the bell jingling cheerfully.

"Morning, Mr. Morrison!" she called toward the back.

My father's grunt carried from the office.

Sandy browsed the paint section, casual as anything, while I pretended to straighten stock. When I was certain my father wasn't watching, I moved closer.

"I need help," I whispered. "Friday night. Eight o'clock. Behind my house."

"Betty Ann—"

"Please. The sock hop. It's important."

Sandy looked at me—really looked at me. Whatever she saw in my face made her expression shift from concern to understanding.

"I'll be there," she whispered back.

Relief flooded through me so powerfully I almost cried right there among the hammers and screwdrivers.

Sandy purchased a can of paint she probably didn't need and left with a cheerful wave. My father never suspected.

Thursday evening, Sandy came for another supervised visit. My mother sat in the living room with us, knitting, ostensibly giving us privacy while clearly listening to every word.

We'd done this dance before—two days of monitored conversations where we discussed nothing of substance. But tonight would be different.

"Are you going to the sock hop tomorrow?" Sandy asked brightly, knowing full well I was forbidden.

"No," I said, matching her light tone. "I'm grounded."

"That's too bad. Everyone's going. Well, almost everyone." Sandy examined her nails. "I heard certain people might not be there. Might be leaving town soon, actually."

My heart clenched but I kept my face neutral. Danny. She'd heard about Danny planning to leave.

"That's a shame," I managed.

"Mmm. I'm trying to decide what to wear. I was thinking about that pink polka dot dress I borrowed from you last summer. Remember? The really pretty one?"

I understood immediately. "I remember. That's my favorite dress."

"You should wear something nice too, even if you can't go out," Sandy continued, her voice casual. "Makes you feel better when you're stuck at home."

"Maybe I will."

My mother looked up from her knitting, suspicious but unable to pinpoint why. Sandy and I smiled innocently at her.

We talked about nothing else important for another twenty minutes. When Sandy left, she squeezed my hand at the door—solidarity, support, you can do this.

I squeezed back. Thank you.

After my parents went to bed Thursday night, I prepared. Quietly, carefully, heart pounding with every movement.

I laid out the pink polka dot dress on my chair. My good shoes. My cardigan. I wanted to look my best. Felt shallow for caring, but I cared anyway.

I tested the window. It opened quietly, thank God. I leaned out and examined the trellis in the moonlight. The wooden frame looked sturdy enough. The climb down would be about twelve feet. Doable. Terrifying, but doable.

I found my small purse and packed it: lipstick, a comb, a handkerchief. Preparing like I was going to battle. In a way, I supposed I was.

I sat on my bed and rehearsed what I'd say to Danny. The words felt both brave and terrifying.

I choose you. I'm not afraid of consequences. You can't leave without me.

What if he'd already decided? What if showing up made things worse? What if my father discovered me gone before I got back?

The risks piled up in my mind like debts I couldn't pay.

But some things were worth the risk. Danny was worth the risk.

I lay in bed for hours, unable to sleep, staring at the ceiling. Tomorrow. Tomorrow I would climb out my window, sneak to the sock hop, and tell Danny Cole that I wasn't giving up on us. That I was choosing my own life, my own future, my own love.

The thought terrified me.

The thought exhilarated me.

For the first time in my life, I was choosing myself.

Friday morning I worked at the hardware store in a daze of nervous energy. My hands shook slightly as I counted change. I dropped a box of screws and they scattered across the floor with a metallic clatter that made my father look up sharply from the counter.

"You all right?" he asked, suspicion in his voice.

"Fine," I said quickly, kneeling to gather the screws. "Just clumsy."

He watched me for a long moment. I could feel his gaze like a physical weight.

"You're not planning something foolish, are you?"

My heart hammered against my ribs. I looked up at him, forced myself to meet his eyes, and lied. "No, sir."

The lie tasted bitter. But necessary.

He studied me, clearly unconvinced but unable to prove anything. Finally, he returned to his inventory list.

I gathered the last of the screws with shaking hands.

The hours crept by with agonizing slowness. Each customer was a delay. Each task felt like it took twice as long as usual. The clock on the wall seemed stuck, time moving through molasses.

Finally—finally—five o'clock arrived. We closed the store. Walked home in silence. I helped my mother prepare dinner while my father read the paper in the living room.

At the dinner table, my parents discussed their church social committee meeting. It would run from seven to nine-thirty, maybe later. They'd be gone for hours.

My father looked at me across the pot roast. "You'll be in your room while we're gone. Door will be locked."

"Yes, sir," I said quietly.

My mother's expression was pained. She hated this—the conflict, the punishment, the disappointment. But she'd never contradict my father. Not about something like this.

After dinner, I went to my room as instructed. I heard my parents preparing to leave—my mother's heels on the hardwood floor, my father's keys jingling.

His footsteps approached my door. The key turned in the lock from outside.

I was trapped. Imprisoned in my own home.

Through the window, I watched their car pull out of the driveway. Watched it disappear down the street. Watched until I was certain they were gone.

Then I changed into the pink polka dot dress. It fit perfectly, the full skirt swishing when I moved. I put on the good shoes, the ones I'd worn to church last Easter. Added the cardigan.

I applied lipstick with hands that wouldn't stop shaking. My reflection in the mirror looked like someone I almost didn't recognize. Determined. Fierce. Terrified.

I grabbed my small purse and moved to the window.

This was it. The point of no return. If I climbed out that window, there was no taking it back. My father would know. The Georgia threat would become reality.

But if I didn't go, Danny would leave. And I'd lose my chance. I'd lose him. I'd lose myself.

I opened the window. The evening air drifted in, warm and humid, carrying the scent of my mother's roses.

I took a deep breath.

And I climbed out my window.

The trellis creaked under my weight but held. My dress snagged on the window frame and I tugged it free. Found a foothold. Another. The thorns caught my cardigan, pulled threads loose. Scraped my hands.

Halfway down, a board cracked under my foot. My heart stopped. I grabbed tighter, found new footing, kept going.

My feet touched grass. I was down. I was out. I'd actually done it.

I ran.

Sandy's car waited behind the house, lights off like we'd planned. I threw myself into the passenger seat, breathless and shaking and triumphant.

Sandy stared at me—at my torn cardigan, my scratched hands, my wild eyes.

"You actually climbed out the window," she said, awed.

I started laughing. Slightly hysterical, relief and terror mixed together. "Yes. I actually did."

Sandy pulled away from the curb carefully, headlights off until we'd turned the corner. Once we were safely out of my neighborhood, we both started giggling—nervous, amazed, giddy.

"I can't believe Betty Ann Morrison just snuck out," Sandy said.

"I can't believe it either," I admitted.

But I had. I'd climbed out my second-story window. I'd defied my father directly.

The high school came into view, lit up for the sock hop. Cars everywhere. Music and laughter pouring from the gymnasium.

"What are you going to do when you get there?" Sandy asked.

"Find Danny," I said. "Tell him not to leave. Tell him I choose him."

"What happens after? When your father finds out?"

I'd been trying not to think about that. "I don't know. But I can't think about it now."

Sandy pulled into the parking lot. "You're the bravest person I know."

I didn't feel brave. I felt terrified. But maybe courage wasn't the absence of fear. Maybe it was doing the thing anyway.

I got out of the car. Smoothed my torn cardigan. Checked my lipstick in the side mirror. Took a deep breath.

The gymnasium doors stood open, spilling light and music into the warm Florida night.

I walked toward them, heart in my throat, ready to fight for the one thing that truly mattered.

Whatever happened next, I'd face it honestly.

No more hiding. No more lies.

I was Betty Ann Morrison, and I was done apologizing for what I wanted.
