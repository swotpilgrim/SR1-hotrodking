# Chapter 26: The Declaration

I must have actually fallen asleep at some point, because I woke to sunlight streaming through my window and the sound of the telephone ringing downstairs.

For one blissful moment, I forgot. Then reality crashed back—the window climb, the sock hop, the kiss, the public declaration. All of it.

I sat up, still wearing my pink polka dot dress, now hopelessly wrinkled. My hands were scratched, scabbed over during the night. My cardigan lay in a torn heap on the floor where I'd discarded it.

The telephone kept ringing. Then my father's voice, answering. A pause. Then: "What?"

His tone made my stomach clench.

"I see," my father said, his voice tight with barely controlled fury. "Thank you for letting me know, Margaret."

Margaret Patterson. From church. I'd seen her in the crowd last night.

The phone receiver clicked back into place. Heavy footsteps on the stairs. Coming fast.

My bedroom door flew open—my father must have unlocked it. He stood in the doorway, face red with anger, still in his pajamas and robe.

"Get dressed," he said, voice dangerously quiet. "Properly dressed. Then come downstairs. Now."

The door slammed shut.

My hands shook as I changed out of the rumpled pink dress and into a simple skirt and blouse. Ran a comb through my tangled hair. There was a thorn stuck in it from the rose vines. I pulled it out, wincing.

No hiding what I'd done. My scratched hands gave me away. The torn cardigan. The fact that I'd been wearing the pink dress to bed.

I took a deep breath and went downstairs.

My parents waited in the living room. My mother sat on the sofa, a handkerchief already in her hands, eyes red. She'd been crying. My father stood by the fireplace, arms crossed, jaw tight.

"Sit," he ordered.

I sat in the armchair across from my mother.

"Margaret Patterson called," my father said. "She felt it was her Christian duty to inform us that she saw you last night. At the high school sock hop. The dance you were explicitly forbidden to attend."

I said nothing. What could I say?

"She also informed us that you were seen kissing that Cole boy. In the parking lot. In front of half the school." My father's voice rose with each word. "Is this true?"

I met his eyes. "Yes."

My mother made a small sound of distress.

"How?" my father demanded. "Your door was locked. I checked on you when we got home. You were in bed."

"I climbed out the window," I said quietly. "Down the rose trellis. Then climbed back up after the dance."

My mother gasped. "Betty Ann! You could have broken your neck!"

"But I didn't."

"That's not the point!" My father's composure cracked. "You lied to us. You deliberately disobeyed. You snuck out of this house like a common—"

"Walter," my mother interrupted softly.

He took a deep breath, visibly trying to control himself. "I told you. I explicitly told you that you were not to see that boy. Not to attend that dance. And you defied me."

"Yes," I said. "I did."

"Why?" The word came out almost pleading. "Why would you throw away everything—your reputation, your future, our trust—for some delinquent with no prospects?"

"Because I love him," I said simply. "And because I'm tired of letting everyone else make my choices for me."

"You're seventeen years old! You don't know what love is!"

"I know enough to recognize it when I feel it," I said. My voice was calm, steady. I'd been terrified last night, but now, facing my father in the clear light of morning, I felt strangely peaceful. "And I know that Danny Cole is not a delinquent. He's smart and hard-working and he supports his entire family. He's more responsible than most adults I know."

"He's trash from the marina district," my father said bluntly. "He's failed school, he races illegally, he fights. He has nothing to offer you."

"He offers me respect," I said. "He treats me like I'm capable of making my own decisions. He believes in my art when no one else does. He sees me, Dad. Really sees me. Not just the perfect daughter you want me to be."

My father's face flushed darker. "We have given you everything. A good home, a good education, a good reputation—"

"You've given me a cage," I interrupted. "A beautiful, comfortable cage where I'm supposed to be grateful and obedient and never want anything you don't approve of."

"Betty Ann!" My mother looked shocked.

"It's true, Mom. I've spent my whole life trying to be perfect. Trying never to disappoint you. Doing everything you expected. And I've been miserable."

"That's not true," my mother protested. "You've been happy. You've always been such a good girl—"

"I've been a good actor," I corrected gently. "But last night, for the first time in my life, I did something just because I wanted to. Not because it was expected or approved of or safe. And you know what? I wasn't miserable. I was happy."

My father's hands clenched into fists. "You will not see that boy again. I forbid it."

"I'm going to see him," I said quietly. "I'm going to keep seeing him. Because I choose to."

"Then you'll do it in Georgia," my father said. "I'm calling your Aunt Ruth today. You'll spend the rest of the summer there. Transfer to their high school for senior year."

My mother gasped. "Walter, that seems extreme—"

"It's decided." My father's voice was final. "She goes to Georgia. Today, if possible."

"Fine," I said. The word surprised even me. "Send me to Georgia. I'll write to Danny every day. I'll count down until I turn eighteen in November. Then I'll come back. Or he'll come there. You can't keep us apart forever."

"You're being ridiculous," my father said. "This infatuation will pass. You'll meet other boys, realize what a mistake—"

"It's not a mistake," I said firmly. "And it's not an infatuation. I love him. And even if you send me to Georgia, even if you disown me, even if every person in this town judges me—I'll still love him."

My father stared at me like I was a stranger. "I don't know who you are anymore."

"I'm your daughter," I said. "But I'm also my own person. And I'm done pretending those two things can't exist together."

Silence fell in the living room. My mother cried quietly into her handkerchief. My father looked like he'd aged ten years.

Finally, my father spoke. "Go to your room. Pack your things. We'll discuss arrangements for Georgia."

I stood. "I need to see Danny first. To tell him—"

"Absolutely not."

"Then I'll write him a letter. He deserves to know I'm leaving."

"Fine." My father waved his hand dismissively. "Write your letter. But then you're going upstairs and staying there until we leave for Georgia."

I nodded and headed for the stairs. At the doorway, I paused and looked back at my parents.

"I'm sorry I disappointed you," I said quietly. "I never wanted to hurt you. But I'm not sorry for loving Danny. And I won't apologize for choosing myself."

My mother looked up, tears streaming down her face. "Baby, we just want what's best for you—"

"I know," I said. "But what's best for me is my choice to make."

I went upstairs to my room and closed the door. Sat at my desk with a piece of stationery. Picked up my pen.

*Dear Danny,*

The words flowed easily, surprisingly. I told him about my father's call from Mrs. Patterson. About the confrontation. About Georgia. About my promise to write him every day.

About how I wasn't sorry. Not for any of it.

I sealed the letter in an envelope, addressed it to Danny at the marina district address he'd told me during one of our tutoring sessions. I'd have Sandy mail it for me.

Then I started packing. Not many clothes—just enough for Georgia. My sketchbook, definitely. My art supplies. The seashell Danny had given me that day at the beach.

Evidence of the real Betty Ann Morrison. The one who climbed out windows and chose love over safety.

The one I was still becoming.

A knock at my door. "Come in," I called.

My mother entered, handkerchief still clutched in her hand. She looked at my half-packed suitcase, at the letter on my desk, at me.

"I don't understand," she said quietly. "We gave you everything. Why wasn't it enough?"

I went to her, took her hands gently. "You gave me everything except permission to want things for myself. Everything except the freedom to make mistakes. Everything except trust that I could handle my own life."

"We were protecting you—"

"I know. But Mom, I don't need protection from my own choices. I need your faith that I'm strong enough to handle the consequences of those choices."

My mother's eyes filled with tears again. "This boy. Does he really make you happy?"

"He makes me brave," I said. "He makes me believe I can be more than just the good daughter. He makes me feel seen."

She touched my scratched hands gently. "You could have seriously hurt yourself on that trellis."

"But I didn't."

"This time." She sighed. "Your father's very angry. It might take him time to come around."

"I know. I can wait."

My mother hesitated, then pulled me into a hug. "I love you. Even when I don't understand you."

"I love you too, Mom."

She pulled back, wiping her eyes. "Finish packing. We'll probably leave tomorrow morning."

After she left, I returned to my suitcase. Georgia. A new town. A new school. Away from Danny, from Sandy, from everything familiar.

But only for a few months. Only until November when I turned eighteen.

I could survive a few months.

And in the meantime, I'd write letters. I'd plan my future. I'd hold onto the courage I'd found last night.

Because I'd climbed out a window for love.

And I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
