# Chapter 21: Danny's Decision

The wrench slipped in Danny Cole's hand, scraping knuckles scabbed over from Saturday's fight. He didn't flinch. The pain barely registered.

He tightened the carburetor bolt, then loosened it. The engine didn't need tuning, but working kept him from thinking.

The garage was quiet except for tool clanks and distant waves. His cherry red '55 Ford gleamed under the overhead bulb, fastest car in Coral Bay. Should have felt like victory. Instead, all Danny saw was Betty Ann's face when her father's truck pulled up—the humiliation, the fear.

He'd invited her knowing the risks. Known her father would find out.

Danny's lip was still swollen, knuckles raw. Physical pain was easy. This other pain hollowed him out from the inside.

The garage door creaked open behind him. Danny didn't look up.

"You planning to rebuild that engine from scratch or just stand there pretending to work on it?"

Tommy's voice. Thirteen years old and already too smart for his own good. Danny's younger brother stepped into the garage, school books tucked under one arm.

"I'm working," Danny said, selecting a different wrench he didn't need.

"You've been working since you got home two hours ago." Tommy dropped his books on the workbench. "And I heard you talking to Mama this morning. About leaving town."

Danny's hand stilled on the wrench. He should have known Tommy would overhear. The house was small, walls thin, secrets impossible to keep.

"Just thinking about it," Danny said carefully.

"Are you leaving or not?"

Danny set down the wrench and faced his brother. No point lying. Tommy would see through it anyway. "Maybe. After the Fourth of July sock hop on Friday. The race money covered bills for a few months. Could find better work in the next town, send more money home."

"That's bull and you know it." Tommy's voice rose with anger. "You're leaving because of her. Because of Betty Ann."

"Keep your voice down—"

"Why?" Tommy stepped closer, chin lifted in defiance. "Mama knows. I know. You've been moping around here for two days like somebody died."

Danny felt his jaw tighten. "I'm not moping."

"You're leaving." Tommy's voice cracked slightly. "You're running away because you think you ruined her life or whatever. But did you ever think that maybe she chose to come to that race? That she's not some fragile little thing that needs you to protect her from her own choices?"

The words hit harder than Snake's punches had. Danny turned back to the car, gripping the edge of the hood. The metal was cool under his palms, solid and real.

"You don't understand," Danny said quietly. "Betty Ann's grounded indefinitely because of me. Her father hates me. Her reputation—"

"Her reputation?" Tommy's laugh was bitter. "Since when do you care about reputation? People have been talking about us our whole lives. Poor Cole kids from the marina district."

"Don't—"

"Then don't act like leaving is noble." Tommy's eyes were wet now, angry tears he was too stubborn to let fall. "You think Betty Ann's better off without you? Fine. But don't pretend you're doing it for her. You're doing it because you're scared."

The accusation hung in the air between them. Danny wanted to deny it, wanted to explain about protecting Betty Ann from the life that came with loving someone like him. But the words tangled in his throat.

The screen door squeaked. Their mother stepped onto the porch—Elena Cole, tired from her double shift, shoulders slumped, graying hair loose.

"You two arguing where everyone can hear?" She didn't sound angry. "Tommy, go inside. Danny, I want a word."

Tommy shot Danny one last look before grabbing his books. The door slapped shut.

Elena walked down the steps, favoring her bad knee, and stopped at the garage entrance.

"You're leaving town?"

"Thinking about it."

"Because of the Morrison girl."

"Her name's Betty Ann."

"I know." Elena sat on the workbench stool. "Do you love her?"

Danny's hand stilled. Nobody had asked him directly. The words felt too big.

"Yeah," he admitted. "I do."

"Does she love you?"

"I think so. But maybe she shouldn't."

Elena was quiet. Outside, Marco and Sarah played, their voices carrying across the yard.

"Your father's family didn't approve of me," Elena said.

Danny looked up, surprised.

"Why not?"

"I was poor. My daddy died young in fish processing. My mama cleaned houses." Elena's smile was sad. "They wanted him to marry the pharmacist's daughter. Pretty girl with prospects." Her eyes were distant. "But your father chose me anyway. Twenty years before the accident. Not enough. But I don't regret one."

The ache in Danny's chest intensified. "Look where choosing you got him, Ma. Dead at forty, just like people said. Look where it got you—working yourself to death trying to feed us."

"Is that what you think?" Elena's voice sharpened. "That I regret your father? That I regret you kids?"

"I think Betty Ann deserves better than this." Danny gestured around the garage, the run-down marina district visible beyond. "Better than struggling to pay rent. Better than watching the person she loves work night shifts until he can't stay awake in class. Better than being looked down on by everyone in town."

"So you're going to decide for her what she deserves."

The words were quiet but landed like a slap. Danny opened his mouth to argue, but Elena continued.

"Your father's family tried to decide for him too. Told him I'd drag him down, that he was throwing away his future." Elena leaned forward. "You know what he told them?"

Danny shook his head.

"He said Elena's not being dragged—she's choosing. And I'm choosing her." Elena reached out and gripped Danny's shoulder, her hand surprisingly strong. "Did Betty Ann look like she was being dragged when she showed up at your race?"

"No," Danny admitted. "She looked scared. And brave."

"Like she was choosing," Elena finished. "So tell me, Danny—are you any better than her father if you make this decision without her? If you leave because you think you know what's best for her life?"

The words hit like a punch to the gut. Danny thought about Walter Morrison standing in front of Betty Ann, forbidding her from seeing him. Making decisions for her. Controlling her life because he thought he knew better.

"I'm not trying to control her," Danny said, but the protest sounded weak. "I'm trying to protect her."

"From what? From loving someone who loves her back? From making her own choices?" Elena stood slowly, joints creaking. "Your father protected me from his family's judgment, from people who looked down on us, from going hungry more times than I can count. But he never once tried to protect me from him. He trusted me to know my own heart."

Danny's throat felt tight. "What if I can't give her what she needs?"

"What if you can?" Elena moved toward the door and paused. "But you'll never know if you run away before giving either of you a chance to find out."

She left him alone in the garage, the single bulb swinging slightly in the breeze from the open door. Danny sat on the concrete floor surrounded by tools and motor oil and the hot rod that represented the only thing he'd ever been proud of accomplishing.

Tommy's words echoed: You're doing it because you're scared.

His mother's words echoed: Are you any better than her father if you decide for her?

And underneath both, Betty Ann's voice from their last real conversation, sitting on the beach watching the sun set: You helped me find courage I didn't know I had.

Maybe that was the problem. Danny had plenty of courage for street racing, for fistfights, for working double shifts, for standing up to anyone who threatened his family. But facing a future with Betty Ann, risking disappointing her, possibly failing her—that terrified him more than anything.

But running away was the coward's choice. He'd known it even when Tommy said it, even when his mother pointed it out. Leaving might feel like sacrifice, might feel like love, but it was really just fear dressed up in nobility.

Danny stood, joints protesting from sitting on cold concrete. He looked at his hot rod, at the duffel bag he'd already started packing, sitting in the corner of the garage.

He could stay. Face her father, work harder, prove himself. Give Betty Ann the choice her father and Danny himself had been trying to take away from her.

Or he could leave Friday night after the sock hop. Spare her the struggle, the judgment, the hard years ahead that came with loving someone from the wrong side of town.

The easy choice versus the right one.

Danny picked up his wrench, turned back to the engine he didn't need to fix. His hands moved automatically, adjusting and readjusting, while his mind circled the same impossible question.

By the time the sun set over Coral Bay, casting long shadows through the garage, Danny had made his decision.

He'd go to the sock hop Friday night. He owed the racing crowd that much—they'd want to see him there, celebrating his win. And after the dance ended, after everyone went home, he'd pack his duffel onto his motorcycle and leave.

Betty Ann would be hurt at first. Probably hate him. But she'd heal. She'd go to art school, meet someone appropriate, have the life she deserved.

Danny loved her enough to let her go, even if it tore him apart.

He told Tommy to pass the message to Sandy, Betty Ann's friend. Let Betty Ann know he was leaving so she didn't wonder, didn't wait. Clean break. Kindest option.

Tommy called him a coward again but delivered the message anyway.

Danny returned to the garage, to the car that had won him money but couldn't buy him the one thing he wanted most. His hands moved over familiar metal, heart breaking quietly, making plans to leave behind the only girl who'd ever really seen him.

Friday. After the sock hop. Then he'd leave Coral Bay and Betty Ann Morrison behind, before he could do any more damage to the perfect life she was meant to have.

It was the right choice.

It had to be.

Even if it felt like dying.
